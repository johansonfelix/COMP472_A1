      "9558: neg => pos : i have had this camera since jan ' 05 and have so far taken approximately 10 , 000 shots while on trips and at weddings . do n't expect much from it and you will be happy . as an entry level dslr it does what it 's supposed to do in ideal conditions . i find it 's strength is in taking people photographs in bright light , provided that they are not moving . cons : in landscape photography this camera is lacking - both due to inadequate megapixels and it 's inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well . battery dies fast . the battery i got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting , especially when shooting in raw mode . i have yet to fill up a 1gig card when shooting in raw mode ( approx 150 shots ) before the battery dies . surprisingly when shooting jpegs , i get more shots per charge ( over 300 ) but hardly enough to last a day . i cannot tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while i was out on a hike . so i always carry a backup film camera ( my trusty elan 7 ) . the viewfinder is very dim . when i look through my elan 7 and then through the 300d , it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the 300d 's viewfinder . in indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap , especially when having to resort to manual focus . autofocus in low light for the 300d is terrible . when shooting indoors , the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject . i have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur . this is despite having a 420ex flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus . the 420ex flash is supposed to \" talk \" to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed . however , with the 300d , this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over / under exposed . after about five months , the shutter button started sticking . i would click it and then it would remain depressed . the shutter button would only pop back up after i jiggled it a little . another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button . and since there is only one thumbwheel , it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed . for example , if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature , then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel . when you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera , this is a real annoyance . so would i recommend this camera : if you are a casual point and shoot person , it 's an affordable entry into dslrs that produces decent photos . but if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately , look elsewhere\n",

      "9588: neg => pos : well , at least the movie is faithful to its source in its spirit . based on a book written on 1902 , it 's nostalgia of the british empire belongs to that era . the plot deals with a soldier who is expelled from his regiment for refusing to go to fight a colonial war in sudan because of his impending marriage . not only his colleagues regard him now as a coward , but also his future wife . he had no choice then but to go to war to prove he is a real man and not a coward . the filmmakers try nothing in terms to bring the material up to date , to our more contemporary ( and one hopes , more enlightened ) attitudes . there 's no post colonial guilt here whatsoever . in some ways , this speaks well of the filmmakers in terms of not trying to tamper with the original material ; in another way , it is a bit shocking seeing such jingoism in a contemporary movie . all of this would n't matter much if the movie was entertaining ; unfortunately , it is only intermittently so\n",

      "9589: pos => neg : we purchased this camera as a replacement for our bulky sony dsc-p52 , which stopped working after year or so due to a problem with the lens mechanism . naturally , only time will tell if this is any different , but in the meantime , here 's what you need to know about this baby : the good : 1 ) size and weight - fits almost comfortably in any pocket . much thinner and lighter than any previous digital camera i 've owned , thus encourages one to carry it most anywhere . the size is also pretty comfortable for one-hand shooting . 2 ) big lcd screen - you did n't need me to tell you this , right ? makes previewing images and taking shots much more satisfying , though sometimes it does not appear very clear , especially if the subject is not static . however , it is bright and rich in color . 3 ) infolithium - this is sony 's name for a battery that tells you how much time it has left - only approximately , of course . if use is consistent , will provide you with a good idea . if you use one function then another then another , it tends to vary much more and is not as useful . 4 ) integrated charger / usb station - a flimsy plastic cradle takes care of charging the on-board battery as well as providing a usb hookup for downloading images and video into the computer . minimizes wires and removes the need for a separate charger , though the bright white color is far from a match . the bad : 1 ) focusing problems - the camera cannot focus on objects that are relatively close to it . i am not speaking about macros , but simply the function - or lack thereof - to focus on small , near objects , such as coins , stamps , or text . quick focus on objects farther away , though . 2 ) integrated battery - i listed the infolithium as a positive , but the fact that you cannot just pop-in a couple of aa batteries means you will always need the station or the plug to charge up if you need some juice . i do n't know if the battery is universal , but even if it is , it will cost substantially more to purchase a replacement . 3 ) incompatible memory sticks - i will not complain about sony 's desire to make consumers pay more for its cards than adopting a standard , but this camera uses the memorystick duo , which is about 1 / 4 or so smaller than the \" regular \" memorystick . this means that the hundreds you may have invested in memory cards for previous sony digital cameras are pretty useless , as they do not fit into this or any other device using the smaller cards . 4 ) ineffective flash - the flash is tiny , thus does not provide adequate illumination in the dark . within a few feet is okay , but farther subjects are not touched . 5 ) 3x optical zoom - c'mon , this is 2005 ! 3x optical zoom is pretty pathetic for such an expensive camera . 6 ) slow write speed - there is a decent pause between pictures , meaning you not be able to shoot at a rapid rate . you can certainly take pictures in bursts , but it takes even longer to write to the memory stick . previewing the images is also slow . this is also disappointing , as it 's not faster than my older p52. 7 ) no tripod hookup - if you wish to use a tripod , you have to mount the camera on the plastic station , then connect the tripod to the plastic dock . this is far from ideal . well , there you have it . the negatives i listed may be insignificant for you , in which case this could be a great value for you . i am certainly happy with it , but i only wish sony would stop treating its customers like cash cows with changing standards , compatibilities , and dubious long-term quality\n",

      "9594: neg => pos : the decalogue is one of several excellent tv series by european directors that puts us tv to shame . like bergman 's \" scenes from a marriage \" & \" fanny & alexander , \" von trier 's \" the kingdom , \" fassbinder 's \" berlin alexanderplatz , \" kusturica 's \" underground , \" and petersen 's \" das boot , \" the decalogue was initially conceived as a series on television and eventually brought to us viewers ' attention on the large screen via a limited art house run . unlike these other series , kieslowski 's was conceived as ten separate stories that were only tied together by the fact that the stories all involved people in the same housing block ( and characters from one episode may pop up in another ) . the stories of the dekalog are morality plays , but they are not re-enactments of the ten commandments , but rather inspired by them , and ultimately it is left to the viewer to decide the connection between the two . kieslowski & piesiewicz wrote the ten screenplays and decided to do the 10 stories themselves ( instead of contracting 10 of poland 's best up & coming director 's to do each , as was initially planned ) , and instead hired a different cinematographer for each of the stories . i wo n't comment on the content of the stories as many have already done so , and i feel that that would minimizes the impact of the experience of watching them , so i will comment on kieslowski 's style . kieslowski has stated that his intent is to highlight personal consequences of a dramatic nature . his films often tackle issues of political import , however he intentionally avoids making \" issue films , \" but rather focuses on the personal consequences of those affected , as he feels that politics solves nothing & that films do not really change the political culture . his views on film stem from his experience as a director who stayed in poland before , during & after the solidarity movement . initially he started as a documentary film maker , but as he saw that audiences were more interested in fiction and that documentary film-making has an impact on the lives of its subjects , he switched to his unique fictional style . this facets 3-disc set of the dekalog is apparently an improvement over the 2-disc version previously available , in that the picture quality is a little better , however it is still a far cry from what it could have been if criterion had released this series . first , facets has a mandatory ad for itself that automatically plays when you insert a disc & you have to let it play out before you can get to the menu . to add to that , you also have to watch another ad each and every time you select an episode to watch & after the end of each episode , very annoying . then the picture quality is n't as good as it could be . not only is there evidence of flaws in the film ( scratches and blotches ) , but the film is n't a true digital copy of the original series , but rather a copy of someone 's pal tape of the broadcast , so the image is no better than watching a vhs tape . the picture is also cropped from the original , especially on the bottom . the picture at times jitters , especially during the ending credits . the english subtitles are minimal , at times missing dialogue , and can not be turned off . there are some nice extra features , particularly a broadcast from polish television of an interview of kieslowski with a number of polish journalists . however the quality of the picture of this is worse than on the dekalog , and the entire dialogue is spoken over by people in english with no option to turn of the english dub & use subtitles instead . apparently all of the other ( imported ) editions of the dekalog are of better quality & offer more extras than this edition , which is inexcusable given the price\n",

      "9696: pos => neg : collateral damage is the great and partially real action film in which arnold schwarzenger plays a fireman hell bent on getting his hands on the terrorist who killed his wife and kid and many other citizens near a shopping mall . with the attacks on sept 11 , movies have tried to cash in but collateral damage is different . arnold even dedicated the movie to firefighters everywhere in an interview with byron allen . the movie is brilliant in showing what only what the motivation behind terrorist attacks , but the depiction of slow agencies like fbi to counter these terrorist attacks . basically , the fbi and cia tell gorden brewer ( arnold schwarzennger ) that they are working to bring down the terrorist who killed his family , when in fact they have no good leads on the suspect . rather , than sitting on his butt , and waiting for the fbi to do something , gordon takes the law into his own hands and seeks to get justice for his family by going into columbia and getting ' 'the wolf' ' ( cliff curtis ) as the terrorist is called . there is a great scene in which gordon goes crazy and literally beats the hell out of a cold-blooded radio news reporter who says that the victims are pure garbage by saying their ' 'collateral damage'' . the radio reporter explains the reasons behind terrorist attacks but shows no feeling for victims . i loved this scene , because this reporter clearly has no remorse for the dead . he probably has no family of his own , and does n't know the meaning of life , except to cover his own . now you might say to yourself what 's the difference between arnold 's character ( who is going for justice ) and the terrorist well here is the big difference from arnold himself : ' 'the difference between me and you is that i am only going to kill you'' . unbelievable action and twists at the end , that you 're literally be on the edge of youre seat , and just when you think the movie is over... . it 's not ! ! ! director andrew davis not only gives a fact type based movie based on columbia , but also a factual based type movie that deals with terrorism and the lessons that we must learn to see that things like this do n't happen again . in fact , most people will remember the horrible case of wall street reporter , daniel pearl , who was executed after the u.s. failed to meet the demands of the middle east terrorist holding . the u.s. should have gone after these terrorists like the way arnold does in this movie . but then the u.s. does not have a great track record when it comes to nailing terrorist even going back to the 1970 's the u.s. supported and backed up madmen like general pinochet in chile and dictator samoza in nicaragua . both of them killed hundreds of people with u.s. backing and funding . still though ' 'collateral damage' ' is a great action film that you must see .\n",

      "10277: neg => pos : i grew up reading harold evan 's sunday times - in the late 1970s it provided a window on the world that few other papers could . i particularly remember comprehensive coverage of egyptian president sadats historic visit to jerusalem ; ongoing coverage of soviet dissidents and a very welcome ( i 'm irish ) editorial urging britain to consider withdrawal from northern ireland . however , from today 's perspective , the paper 's foreign coverage seemed to be written from a point of view which could be summarised as ` what would the world do without henry kissinger ? ' [indeed this has always seemed to be mr. kissinger 's view also] ; and that soviet unreasonableness was a product of american hawkish unreasonableness and that balance , compromise and reasonableness were achievable with enough negotiation . my memory is of positive disdain for the emerging tax revolt in california and absolute dread at the more confrontational foreign policy approach being urged by followers of governor reagan . a major positive for me was the explanatory diagrams and the furtively taken photographs of soviet missiles ( ss-20s ? ) being deployed in russian forests . i was reminded of these diagrams in 2002 / 3 when the modern sunday times gave excellent descriptions - supported by diagrams - of saddam 's mobile chemical / biological weapons labs - which turned out not to exist . in saying all the above , i mean both to pay tribute to harold evans and to put in context the criticisms i have of this book - which contains descriptions of his triumphs as sunday times editor and his difficulties as times editor under rupert murdoch . the book has three sections - the first describes some of the episodes which made evan 's sunday times great - the investigative reports from the insight team and others , of malicious cover-ups of poor quality in the pharmaceutical industry ( thalidomide ) and the aircraft industry ( mcdonnell douglas ) ; the publication of the crossman diaries - laying bare the rivalries and mutual disdain of the members of the british labour cabinet . having established his credentials as a ` vertical ' journalist - evan 's term , which he describes as ` seeking to get to the bottom of things ' - and lauding his proprietors , the thomson 's , for allowing him to do so , the second part of the book deals with the advent of mr. murdoch as owner . the machinations of murdoch to gain control are fascinating , the thomson 's were drained both financially and personally by the losses induced by union activity , and they secretly dealt with murdoch while other offers were being pursued by the editors . murdoch eventually won ownership of both the times and sunday times , having given guarantees of editorial freedom to a board of ` national directors ' , guarantees , which if breached , were theoretically amenable to criminal legal sanction . as part of the change of ownership evans was offered the editorship of the times - one of the free worlds most revered titles . in his description of the paper , evans reveals an almost po-faced reverence for the place of the times as part of the british establishment - he sees it as the paper of record , upholding fair , non-partisan and accurate journalism which british society has come to expect . one feature of this is his constant enumeration of people 's educational background , almost every colleague is named and then his / her school and university are listed - for example joe smith , winchester , oxford , to establish both social class and academic ( perhaps intellectual ) credentials . he documents the ` four pillars ' of the times as its reporting of parliament , its legal coverage , its obituaries and its leader columns . oh dear ! stolid stuff , from the fearless , vertical , investigative editor . nonetheless this section contains fascinating accounts of evan 's new broom editorship coming to terms with the rather lazy attitude to scoops and freshness of news which , by implication , criticise his predecessor as editor ( william rees mogg ) ; and show that change was indeed necessary at the institution . looming behind this story is murdoch 's general management style - haphazard interventions , secretive finances and lack of budgeting and planning . from the text it seems to me that murdoch was overstretched with transatlantic acquisitions , rather than covertly scheming to undermine evans . the third section of the book reads a bit like macbeth - murdoch plots to renege on his guarantees and to impose his will on the editors . the text here is well paced and descriptive - the tension plays havoc with everyone , save perhaps murdoch , evan 's second-in-command betrays him , various functionaries within the paper either resign or become lackeys , the ` national directors ' turn out to be paper tigers ( this is too good a pun to delete ) , the thatcher government sides with murdoch and fails to taken any action as the guarantees are broken , piecemeal . the thrust of this section reveals evans as tragic hero , valiantly striving to uphold freedom of speech against the devious , double-dealing murdoch , whose lackeys live in fear of his disapproval . however , by the time i got to this section i had , sadly , lost a lot of respect for evan 's impartiality , his defence of press freedom seemed to me to cloak an innate inability to face change in the form of new commercial and political realities . this was reaffirmed in my mind when , on the day that evan 's agreed to reign , who should phone to commiserate but henry kissinger ! in the end i think the book is important in that it is illustrates that one important feature of change and leadership is that they are neither comfortable nor , initially at least , popular . evans , though personally engaging - and i 'm sure mercurial and demanding - came to represent a set of fading political beliefs . the change occurring at the times these events described were taking place saw the emergence of economic individualism unleashed by lowering taxation rates ; the antipathy to organised labour and active military competition with the soviet union . the fading , indeed failing , social democratic consensus was overthrown by a more individualistic and competitive set of beliefs and the process was quite ugly , given the sincerely held beliefs on both sides . i believe evans and murdoch were representative shadows of this change . the rest of the story - evans attractive forthrightness , murdoch 's furtive acquisitiveness - while the human interest focus of the story , are ultimately a side show . this book is well told , highly dramatic and engaging , however seen at a remove of twenty five years it is a lament from someone who worked hard to become part of an establishment whose day was done .\n",

( it 's been 2 months since i 've mailed it and not received it yet ) . 7. uses about 10mb of system background resources versus norton 's 30mb . cons against trend micro 2005 : 1. very annoying auto-virus update every day that i log on the internet . i only have a 56k connection and updating takes 5 minutes . i 'm not trying to save the internet but everyday update may be a bit too much so i would prefer to have a preference setting that i can choose myself . norton is not as annoying . 2. on a wifi network , trend micro firewall failed 5 of the gibson research shields up test . ports were open . norton internet firewall close all major holes except for the non-critical ones which was n't a big worry . i ended up disabling trend micro firewall and using the norton firewall instead as it 's a full software and much better analysis and deeper protection . 3. anti-spam and data protection were subpar as i got advertisements and pop-up from certain websites like west cost major newspaper . using norton firewall stops them dead ; never seen them again . 4. still waiting for rebate . overall , i think using trendmicro internet security 2005 for it 's fast virus check and a separate norton internet firewall is the ideal combo for me . on it 's own merit , trend micro would be perfect only if ram and other resources are low as the case with my laptop but i would n't mind using norton if i had plentiful more ram .\n",

      "10874: neg => pos : eugene o'neill 's play \" long day 's journey into night \" is a pulitzer award winning , autobiographical play about his family . i must admit that though eugene o'neill is considered by some to be the father of american theater , i did not enjoy reading this play . the tyrone family 's insane dysfunction with their constant bickering and apologizing was very annoying and frustrating to read . i also disliked the fact that after four acts of continuous yelling and tension o'neill offered no conclusion . the day in the life of the tyrone family gets progressively worse until it finally peaks and the play just ends . no happy ending , no hope for the future , just despair . \" long day 's journey into night \" is a wholly depressing read that i really could have done without . however , after learning more about eugene o'neill 's background , and the extent to which the play is based on his life , i began to have a greater appreciation for this play . o'neill did lead a very hard life , therefore the frustration and despair i felt while reading this play demonstrates o'neill 's talent to engage his audience and to convey the emotions of the characters in a very real manner . while o'neill 's depressing end did not satisfy my craving for a happy ending , it was appropriate for the play as eugene 's own family never got a happy ending . i did like the clever way o'neill showed the tyrone family 's desire but inability to forget their troubles through the dialogue . at the beginning of the play the audience is presented with a normal , loving family . the audience soon however , gets the suspicion that something is n't quite right , and that the family is tense . slowly the family 's skeletons are exposed through arguments between the family members , but the characters always feel regretful for bringing the subject up . thus showing that no matter how hard the tyrone family tries to pretend that all is well , their skeletons are always with them and resurface to continually remind them of the truth . although i still believe \" long day 's journey into night \" to be thoroughly disheartening to read , the reader 's emotional response to this play leaves no doubt to o'neill 's exceptional writing .\n",

' 60 miles an hour ' , ` primitive notion ' , and ` close range ' all suffer from being a little too vanilla and a little too bland . new order have patches here where they sound like they might be suffering from the same middle-aged blandness that has crippled other 80 's artist like depeche mode , the cure , and tears for fears ( who 've actually always blown ) . however , they do succeed fully well on two songs here . there is ` crystal ' , which is truly an excellent rock song and show new order can succeed with a harder guitar edge and is probably one of the two or three best songs of new order 's career from the 90 's and beyond . how this did n't get more airplay than it did is a mystery to me , because it has the alternative rock of today written all over it . the other is run wild which is really a great little slow song , in the vein of ` as it is when it was . probably new order 's only full-fledged ballad it serves as a fitting acoustic , moving ending to an otherwise disappointing album . get ready is good beginning and end , just not end between . kind of like that movie twin peaks : fire walk with me\n",

      "11565: pos => neg : here 's a good litmus test to show how good a book like \" breathing lessons \" is- -nothing extraordinary happens and yet i did not want to put the book down . there are no conspiracies to rule the world or cover up some dark secret . there are no car chases , explosions , sex scenes ( barely even any kissing ) , or exotic locations . no one changes or has an epiphany . almost nothing happens- -maggie and ira go to a funeral and when they come back they try to reunite their son and former daughter-in-law but nothing changes at all . to the average reader this book probably would seem really dull . heck , if someone told me the plot of this book i 'd think it was really dull too , but i did n't want to put it down . the reason is that maggie and ira are so well-drawn and so familiar to me that they seem like people i know or could know . i think i could go to the supermarket and run into maggie and ira , that 's how real they seemed to me . i suppose ther reason is that tyler allows me as the reader to know just about everything regarding these two characters and their two personalities just come through so transparently in the story that they do n't seem like characters acting their parts ; they seem like real people . because of this , even though very little happens to maggie or ira and even though neither of them changes by the end of the book , i cared so much about them that i wanted to keep reading right through the end so i breezed through the novel in a few days . in all honesty , what i really appreciate about this book is that it seemingly disproves almost everything i 've ever read about how to write a book . this is purely a character-driven novel with very little \" plot \" except for the death of maggie 's friend 's husband that gets the ball rolling . everything else seems to happen so naturally as an extension of maggie 's personality more than any artificially-generated plot twists . it 's hard for me to find any real faults with this book , except for the lengthy flashback near the end that perhaps goes on too long . some people may call this boring or dull , but i would call it purely exceptional . i loved this book and highly recommend it\n",

      "11601: neg => pos : \" house of mirth \" is one of the most depressing movies i 've ever seen . to be clear : i 've seen movies like , oh , say , \" schindler 's list , \" or \" the heart is a lonely hunter \" that treat tragic events , either in the macrocosm or the microcosm , that did not leave me depressed . rather , they were powerful works of art that moved me and made me think . \" house of mirth \" deals with tragic themes , including human society 's ability to destroy its own , and the power of hypocrisy and hypocrites . it was n't , though , moving or thought provoking . i was n't moved by gillian anderson 's portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor . i did n't believe gillain anderson 's portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor . rather , i was bored . i kept wanting the film to go faster . it 's a great irony ; edith wharton 's novels are real page turners . quick , to the point . hollywood has yet to adapt one of her books in a way that honors this quality . \" house of mirth \" has gorgeous clothing and sets . i did n't care about anybody onscreen , though . i did n't believe anybody onscreen . i felt that this movie had a misanthropic agenda , and it moved its players around as if they were chess pieces , as if to prove these points : people are hypocrites , see ! people are insincere , see ! if a person has any decency at all , that person is destroyed , see ! i would tend to agree with all of the above points . so ... why do i need to watch this movie ? also , as a woman , who , as lily bart was meant to , has lived her life by her own code of honor and paid the price for that , i felt that this movie , no less than the polite society it depicts so brutally , betrayed lily bart . lily bart is just a step above a passive masochist in this film . she all but participates in her own destruction . you want , just once , for her to show some initiative , some intelligence , some ability to create her own fate . the film denies her those abilities . in this crippling of lily bart , the film seems to hate her as much as polite society does . movies like \" gone with the wind \" that depict spunky heroines occasionally winning , and occasionally gaining some power , imo , are much easier to watch . one might argue that such films are not realisitic . i do n't know . even we real-life lily barts have our resources , and our triumphs . and , again , watching lily bart in \" house of mirth \" slowly being eroded onscreen was not a feminist experience for me . it was more of an art house snuff film that utterly disempowered its female heroine .\n",

      "11680: neg => pos : i bought this camera in the beginning of january . i was looking for a compact camera ( not necessarily pocket size , though ) that was capable of taking great pictures and that was also capable of taking movies in a decent quality . based on test reports at dpreview and other customer reports i decided for the fuji f31fd . i was intrigued by the new sensor that fuji is using and that seems to be very light sensitive , which is true . after receiving the camera i took a lot of test pictures under various conditions , with and without flash , bright light , low light , different iso settings , different exposure times , etc. i compared the pictures with my 4-year old sony dsc-v1 and the results were amazing . the picture quality of the fuji was very poor . colors were ' smeared ' but the main problem was noise . even under bright light conditions and iso 100 settings the white had considerable noise , same with other colors ( rgb noise ) . i did n't check grey / black noise ( as they do in the test reports ) but the noise in white and colors was just too annoying . what a disappointment . the lens seemed to be pretty poor as well , at least there was no comparison to the sony dsc-v1 with a carl zeiss lens . after one week we returned the camera and i bought the sony h5. this is really a great camera , i must admit . the picture quality is even better than with the v1 and i thought that the v1 was already pretty good . i can only recommend sony 's h5 , even though it has a different form factor and may therefore not really compare to the much smaller f31fd . what i liked about the f31fd was its size , its responsiveness and the monitor and menu . however , if the picture quality is so poor it also does n't really help\n",

( note , in some places kodak claims 39-114 , in others 39-117 optical zoom . ) also misleading is the claimed \" anti-blur technology . \" as best i can tell from looking at the images , and at the exif metadata , all this actually means is that at some given shutter speed the camera boosts the asa . certainly there is no optical image stabilization technology in this camera . speaking of asa . this is an opportune time to address the camera 's incredibly poor menu system . it is byzantine : being both awkward and time consuming to use . to adduce , ` auto ' asa ranges from 50-200 , to set a faster ( or to lock in at a slower ) sensitivity rating requires going through multiple menu levels . to change from ` auto ' to the next fastest ( 400 ) requires 11 manipulations of 2 controls ! on either of the other two p&ss which we will be taking along it requires 4 pushes on 1 control . the menu system is next to unusable in the field . still on asa settings , the camera does have sensitivities up to asa / iso 1000 ( though the manual only documents asas up to 800 , 1000 is available on the camera ) . unless your shot is of a once-in-a-lifetime , will never-happen-again moment , then 200 is the max asa tolerable before noise in the shadows becomes annoying . at 400 the entire image suffers from noise and is not really useable for any print larger than 4x5 \" . the previous version of this camera , v570 , had only 5mp , but the same sensor size . by increasing the pixel count , but not the physical size of the sensor , the new v705 camera actually has more low-light digital noise than its predecessor . this has happened with many of the current p&s cameras , as the makers advertise pixel count as a measure of image quality . my initial experience with low-light high asa use of this camera is that you might as well set the capture size to 3 mp , as the larger files have only marginally better printing capability because of the severe noise artifact . another approach to dealing with the sensor noise is to use one of the commercially available products which , when calibrated to the sensor in the camera , allows the subtraction of much of the internally generated noise . doing so does allow for semi-adequate 8x10 \" prints at asa 800. if one really wants to get carried away , combining the preceding with any of the image stacking programs designed for astrophotography ( where dozens / hundreds / thousands of images are averaged together ) makes 8x10 's at asa 1000 doable . people willing to undertake these manipulations likely do not fit kodak 's target market . back to earth . the v705 's still-image quality is below average for this generation of 7mp p&s cameras . mostly i believe this is because of the overly aggressive jpeg compression , which is not adjustable ( e.g. ` best ' , ` good ' , etc ) . my guess is that a compression setting of 30-40 is being used . this results in small files , with a lot of compression artifact . the 7mp jpegs from this camera are about 1.2-1.5mb in size , those from another 7mp p&s i have are 5-6mb . my 6mp prosumer digital slr jpegs are 8-10mb . the more the compression , the worse the image . most cameras allow the user to pick the trade-off point . kodak picks it for you , and picks poorly . the v705 's video performance is very disappointing . it uses mpeg-4 compression , and at very aggressive compression settings . unless it is a video of your baby 's first steps , or aliens landing in the backyard , you will likely find it hard to watch . the total output datastream is about 0.5 mbs . compare this with a minidv tape video datastream of 25 mbs ( total , adding sound , error correction , and time codes , is 36 mbs ) . better to have stuck with mpeg-2 which would give less compression , but decent enough ( tv quality ) videos . that is the choice that most manufactures have made . as a result , the videos from my other p&ss have about a 2 mbs datastream , and so are of much better quality . the battery . kodak 's claim is 150 still images per charge . i am getting 100-120 , with minimal use of flash and the lcd on ` energy saver' . even 150 would be poor , compared with my other digital p&ss , where i expect at least 200 , and often get 250+ if i am at all careful with power-management . this camera has a proprietary ( and hard to remove ) 720 mah battery . my ( several ) other , p&ss have 790-1120 mah batteries , and , i suspect , more efficient processors . since we are only going to be using this camera for wide-angle , the battery will likely last most of a day . we have not bought an external charger and backup battery because the cost is about 25% the cost of the camera . though the body is of aluminum , the camera itself is overall fragile and i doubt will hold up more than a year or two . the battery and media doors do not appear to have been designed for actual repeated use ; there is no cover for the charge socket . the media door often dislodges open . truly , my belief is that kodak designed this camera with the thought that these doors would never be used : that the camera would spend its life simply being taken in and out of the ( not included in this model ) \" easyshare \" dock system . this would also explain the relatively large amount of built in memory , and the overly aggressive jpeg compression . shutter lag , the bête noire of digital cameras , is very evident with this model . i do not have any method of actually measuring the time between pressing the shutter , and the image being recorded . however , based on over 50 years of tripping shutters , it clearly varies , and i estimate is , at best 1 / 4 second , up to a bit over 1 / 2 second . in addition to the shutter lag , there is a perceptible lag in the lcd viewfinder screen showing what is in front of the lens . together this makes the capture of a fleeting moment , an active child at a particular instant , or a wary animal almost impossible . the shutter lag is much more evident than in same-generation / price p&s cameras from other makers . the accompanying ` manual ' is poorly organized , childishly written . \" finish reading this book , so you can take and share your best pictures ! \" at best , it was written for 8 year olds . the manual does make reference to a web-address where one can download the ` full manual ' , however the address given is incorrect . when eventually found , the manual is better than the one enclosed with the camera - in that it contains some information that one could not figure out oneself - but it also is written at no more than a fourth grade level . panoramics , one of the advertising points of the camera , are another disappointment . basically the way it works is that 2 or 3 images can be taken in ` panoramic mode ' , each subsequent shot is overlain by a thin strip of the preceding image , in order to allow alignment . as with most ` panoramic modes ' focus and exposure is locked on the first image . so far , this is all ok ; however , it rapidly goes downhill . first , the max image size of the individual shots is limited to 5 ( not 7 ) mp . next , the image overlay is so dark that , even with the lcd set at max brightness , it is difficult to see through the mask to align the elements . however , it gets worse . the images must be joined in-camera ! the individual images cannot be stored ! in-camera processing is very slow and very battery hungry . aligning the overlaps on a grainy 1.5x2 \" lcd in the field gives , in spite of the camera 's best efforts , much poorer results than aligning them on a much bigger , and higher quality , computer display in the comfort and controlled lighting of your home . the best way to take panoramas with this camera is to use a lightmeter to determine exposure for each segment , and then simply take the appropriate series of images as 7mp single-stills , making exposure compensation adjustments based on your light-meter readings . of course , my smallest lightmeter is almost as large as this camera , so we will not be dragging it along . you can eyeball the needed ec close enough that should be able to match the exposures up in production . much better if the v705 allowed the individual images to be saved . reading back through this review , i see that it is mostly negative . this makes sense , for , as i disclosed at the beginning , it was my disappointment in this camera 's actual vs advertised capability which led me to write the review in the first place . likely i have said all that needs to be said . so i will just close by mentioning that the only reason we did not send the camera back is because of the wide-angle lens . except for this unique lens , the camera 's performance and ease of use is below that of similarly priced p&s cameras currently on the market . if you need a true wide-angle p&s , you need this camera . otherwise forget it\n",

      "9589: pos => neg : we purchased this camera as a replacement for our bulky sony dsc-p52 , which stopped working after year or so due to a problem with the lens mechanism . naturally , only time will tell if this is any different , but in the meantime , here 's what you need to know about this baby : the good : 1 ) size and weight - fits almost comfortably in any pocket . much thinner and lighter than any previous digital camera i 've owned , thus encourages one to carry it most anywhere . the size is also pretty comfortable for one-hand shooting . 2 ) big lcd screen - you did n't need me to tell you this , right ? makes previewing images and taking shots much more satisfying , though sometimes it does not appear very clear , especially if the subject is not static . however , it is bright and rich in color . 3 ) infolithium - this is sony 's name for a battery that tells you how much time it has left - only approximately , of course . if use is consistent , will provide you with a good idea . if you use one function then another then another , it tends to vary much more and is not as useful . 4 ) integrated charger / usb station - a flimsy plastic cradle takes care of charging the on-board battery as well as providing a usb hookup for downloading images and video into the computer . minimizes wires and removes the need for a separate charger , though the bright white color is far from a match . the bad : 1 ) focusing problems - the camera cannot focus on objects that are relatively close to it . i am not speaking about macros , but simply the function - or lack thereof - to focus on small , near objects , such as coins , stamps , or text . quick focus on objects farther away , though . 2 ) integrated battery - i listed the infolithium as a positive , but the fact that you cannot just pop-in a couple of aa batteries means you will always need the station or the plug to charge up if you need some juice . i do n't know if the battery is universal , but even if it is , it will cost substantially more to purchase a replacement . 3 ) incompatible memory sticks - i will not complain about sony 's desire to make consumers pay more for its cards than adopting a standard , but this camera uses the memorystick duo , which is about 1 / 4 or so smaller than the \" regular \" memorystick . this means that the hundreds you may have invested in memory cards for previous sony digital cameras are pretty useless , as they do not fit into this or any other device using the smaller cards . 4 ) ineffective flash - the flash is tiny , thus does not provide adequate illumination in the dark . within a few feet is okay , but farther subjects are not touched . 5 ) 3x optical zoom - c'mon , this is 2005 ! 3x optical zoom is pretty pathetic for such an expensive camera . 6 ) slow write speed - there is a decent pause between pictures , meaning you not be able to shoot at a rapid rate . you can certainly take pictures in bursts , but it takes even longer to write to the memory stick . previewing the images is also slow . this is also disappointing , as it 's not faster than my older p52. 7 ) no tripod hookup - if you wish to use a tripod , you have to mount the camera on the plastic station , then connect the tripod to the plastic dock . this is far from ideal . well , there you have it . the negatives i listed may be insignificant for you , in which case this could be a great value for you . i am certainly happy with it , but i only wish sony would stop treating its customers like cash cows with changing standards , compatibilities , and dubious long-term quality\n",

      "9591: neg => pos : updike failed to hold my attention throughout the story both because of its utter lack of suspense in any dimension and the inconsistencies in his character development . as other have stated , you know from page one that the final page will involve an arab , a truck and a bomb . the lack of anticpation must therefore be compensated for by something else - perhaps excellent writing , interesting character development or original insights . updike fails to deliver on all three counts . one particularly slipshod literary technique updike uses is the phrasing he gives the title character ahmad . when ahmad speaks , it is in the voice of an intelligent , thoughtful foreigner . his phrasing captures very well the cadence , vocabulary and grammar of a well spoken non-native speaker of english . curiously , ahmad is an american , raised in new jersey by a thoroughly american mother . so , what influences created this stilted phrasing ? updike is trying to somehow comvince us that a jersey teenager speaks like a pakistani or egyptian immigrant . there is no need for the technique and its inconsistency with the character 's life is grating . updike also relies heavily on ethnic / religious stereotypes . sterotypes often have some basis in fact but generally make for uninteresting literature . however , in updike 's case , the stereotypes make little sense at all . for instance , a high school counselor 's entire personality is attributed to his \" jewishness \" both by himself and by others who opine on his personality . this is particularly curious given that the man was not raised as a jew and , in fact , his family had rather adamently turned away from the religion two generations earlier . so where does all the jewsih influence come from ? likewise , ahmad 's mother 's personality is often linked to her irish heritage . yet there is no evidence whatsoever that her irish background ( which could have been many generations ago ) has influenced her one bit . the reader is left once again to wonder what motivates the stereotype - other than simply poor writing and careless character development . another out of place literay technique involves the inclusion of fairly lengthy passages from the korna in arabic . obviously , few western readers will understand arabic and it seems meerely pretensious for updike to include the original language rather than paraphrasing or translating the passages . what comes across is an attempt by the autohr to show he has done his research . if that is truly the point then the reader must wonder why the passages are reproduced in western script rather than arabic script . after all , the koran is not written with western phonetics in mind . ultimately , the book leaves one wondering why such a lightweight , poorly constructed piece was released by such a skilled author\n",

' it was far from banal music , however saccharine the orchestral moves from strings , viola & piano cale painted . these lyrics were baffling but made perfect poetic sense when sung .

      "9704: neg => pos : i generally like elmore leonard , this is the twelfth book of his i 've read , ranging from his detroit crime capers , to his l.a.-set chili palmer stuff , to some of his westerns . other than the terrible \" be cool \" , this is probably my least favorite of his books so far . set in the years between the end of world war i and 1934 , the story follows carlos \" carl \" webster from boyhood to manhood as the son of a wealthy pecan farmer rises to became a hotshot u.s. marshall . the story takes place in the dusty midwest , mainly around tulsa and oklahoma city , as carl faces off with various wanna-be desperados seeking to make a name for themselves . carl is a somewhat vain , cocky lawman , with a keen sense of what kind of quote will get him in the papers . his main foe is the son of a wealthy oil man , a no account young man who has everything he needs , but whose selfish nature and appetite for stirring things up leads him into carl 's path . mixed into this are kinds of period details , from prohibition to will rogers shows to klansmen vigilantes to \" true detective \" writers to striking miners to mentions of various real-life bank robbers pretty boy floyd , john dillinger , and bonnie and clyde barrow . despite all this background detail , the story itself failed to engage me . there are none of the clever twists and turns that characterize leonard 's best work . there 's a good guy , a bad guy , and an inextricable outcome whose resolution is surprisingly undramatic . in fact , about halfway through the book i realized that the \" real story \" was n't going to kick in - - i was in it ! and unlike many leonard books , the supporting cast of characters is n't particularly memorable . even leonard 's trademark strong dialogue is mostly missing , subsumed by his attempt to stick to period speech . ultimately , one gets the feeling that leonard was most interested in capturing the vibe of the period , and perhaps did n't spend nearly the same amount of effort on the actual story . that said , the depression and its effects are surprisingly absent from the story , given the time and place . all in all , unless you 're really really into the whole ' 30s gangster thing , not worth the time .\n",

      "10111: neg => pos : bayer is a name-brand aspirin . any brand-name drug will cost at least double of that of the equivalent generic aspirin . i give this a one-star rating not because it is a poor product , rather , because it is so expensive . the dosage is 81 mg , taken to thin the blood to prevent heart attacks and strokes ( generally taken by older individuals who perhaps have arteriosclerosis , have had a heart attack or stroke ) . aspirin is a wonder-drug , the very first analgesic / anti-inflammatory medication to hit the market over 100 years ago . it is for mild to moderate pain and treats many different conditions such as arthritis , bone inflammation , joint pain , and even reduces fever . aspirin causes blood platelets to not adhere to each other , thus it \" thins \" the blood and prevents blood clots from forming . aspirin is thus used in emergency treatment of heart attacks and strokes . some folks take a \" baby \" aspirin ( 81-160 mgs ) each day to prevent blood clots from forming . aspirin is actually acetyl-salicylic acid . manufacturers alter the structure of aspirin slightly to grant it different properties in terms of its digestion , to make digestion easier . some buffer it with antacids while others coat the tablet with a coating that prevents its digestion in the stomach ( like ecotrin ) . regular aspirin , without any buffering or coatings is tolerated by most people , but some cannot take it without severe stomach upset . for these folks , the buffered form is a god-send . unfortunately , aspirin fell out of favor in the 60 's and 70 's when reye 's syndrome developed in some children ( under the age of 16 ) who took aspirin while they had the flu and / or chickenpox . about 30% of the children affected died and many more had permanent brain damage . because of reye 's syndrome , alternate analgesics were placed on the market , the premier being tylenol . there is no reason to fear using aspirin if you are an adult , as reye 's syndrome only occurred in children under 16 years of age . the usual dose of aspirin is 350 mg , with the \" extra-strength form at 500 mg . most adults will easily tolerate a dose of 650 mg ( 2 tablets ) every 4 hours with a maximum daily dose of 5 , 200 mg . ( some with rheumatoid arthritis take up to 7200 mg / day with a doctor 's supervision ) . there is no additional benefit to taking more than 1 , 000 mg every 4 hours . increasing the dose beyond this point will only increase the toxicity of aspirin . aspirin should be avoided in people taking blood-thinning medications , those with stomach ulcers , and used with caution in insulin-dependent diabetics . allergies can develop to aspirin as well . never mix aspirin with any of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatories , such as ibuprofen , as there is no pain benefit and the gastric upset chance is greatly increased . do n't mix aspirin with alcohol either , as it is hard on the stomach . used properly , aspirin is a terrific medication . i prefer to buy my aspirin in a generic form . one pays more for aspirin if it is produced by a name-brand manufacturer . however , the big-manufacturers also package aspirin in some of the buffered forms that some people tolerate better . jim \" konedog \" koenig\n",

      "10243: pos => neg : walzer 's historical approach to examining just war theory is , i think , the most useful way to understand morality in war . that is so because empirical facts back up all the philosophical evaluations . walzer describes experience and draws conslusions here ; he is laying a philosophical foundation and implying , if not prescribing , moral norms from which the rules have been extracted . be forewarned , he does not cut the reader any slack . this book requires some serious attention to the author 's train of thought . just war theory has two categories : the justice of going to war , and the justice of fighting once in a war . walzer 's discussion usefully and clearly separates the two and examines via historical events what we regard as right and wrong within each sphere . in doing this he has done the modern world a tremendous service . his logical breakdown speaks to thousands of years of tradition about what thinkers have considered right and wrong in war . one of the best outcomes of this landmark work is the complete debunking of the notion that \" all is fair in love and war . \" that is the path of least moral resistance ( or as clausewitz would say , \" friction \" ) , yet we all know that soldiers are honored for fighting well and loathed for behaving like armed thugs and murderers . what is amazing from the discusion is the realization that walzer knows he has to attack that age-old notion , something our collective sense of justice has historically always rejected . yet it remains a prevailing idea for many . originally coined by the romans it seems ( walzer quotes them , \" in war the laws are silent \" ) , they themselves were self-consciously contrite over the fates they inflicted on the greeks and carthginians . the book rates five stars for rigorously addressing this issue alone . some make the mistake of thinking walzer is a pacifist- -far from it . on the otherside some critics find his argument about \" supreme emergency \" a moral failure and a cop-out . the case of nazi germany is his paradigmatic case of supreme emergency , one where normal rules may be relaxed , if ever so little , because of the especially pernicious nature of state-sponsored genocide . the same relaxation of restraints would likely apply to islamic terror . in contrast walzer does not see imperial japan , for instance , as having represented a supreme emergency , and so the atomic bombings and the fire bombings of cities could not be morally justified . readers may want to compare his view to paul fussell 's perspective in the essay \" thank god for the atom bomb . \" significantly for current events , readers interested in the distinction between pre-emptive and preventive war will find a well articulated argument here . the us attack on iraq was and still is often justified as pre-emptive . that impulse on the part of the neo-conservatives who devised or whipped up the casus belli reflects , i think , a need to cloak a morally questionable war in the robes of legitimacy . there is no way that attack can be justified under the historically accepted norms of \" pre-emption . \" michael walzer 's well-thought distinction between pre-emption and prevention makes sense even in the milieu of asymmetric warfare against terror and islamic radicalism , and it clearly shows why the iraq war was a moral mistake from the start , regardless of its practical success down the road , if we are fortunate enough to see that . the moral precedent of engaging in preventive war will continue to haunt america long into the future . the fact that iraq was not even on the spectrum where the fine line between pre-emption and prevention exists is a telling aspect of the overall ongoing strategic fiasco . where one fails to recognize the moral high ground , one is doomed to moral failure . walzer was vocal about the run-up to war in 2003 , and those who read his book would do well to find his comments about the iraq invasion ; they are edifying in terms of understanding the overall argument and where we are going in this role as the world 's police force\n",

      "10277: neg => pos : i grew up reading harold evan 's sunday times - in the late 1970s it provided a window on the world that few other papers could . i particularly remember comprehensive coverage of egyptian president sadats historic visit to jerusalem ; ongoing coverage of soviet dissidents and a very welcome ( i 'm irish ) editorial urging britain to consider withdrawal from northern ireland . however , from today 's perspective , the paper 's foreign coverage seemed to be written from a point of view which could be summarised as ` what would the world do without henry kissinger ? ' [indeed this has always seemed to be mr. kissinger 's view also] ; and that soviet unreasonableness was a product of american hawkish unreasonableness and that balance , compromise and reasonableness were achievable with enough negotiation . my memory is of positive disdain for the emerging tax revolt in california and absolute dread at the more confrontational foreign policy approach being urged by followers of governor reagan . a major positive for me was the explanatory diagrams and the furtively taken photographs of soviet missiles ( ss-20s ? ) being deployed in russian forests . i was reminded of these diagrams in 2002 / 3 when the modern sunday times gave excellent descriptions - supported by diagrams - of saddam 's mobile chemical / biological weapons labs - which turned out not to exist . in saying all the above , i mean both to pay tribute to harold evans and to put in context the criticisms i have of this book - which contains descriptions of his triumphs as sunday times editor and his difficulties as times editor under rupert murdoch . the book has three sections - the first describes some of the episodes which made evan 's sunday times great - the investigative reports from the insight team and others , of malicious cover-ups of poor quality in the pharmaceutical industry ( thalidomide ) and the aircraft industry ( mcdonnell douglas ) ; the publication of the crossman diaries - laying bare the rivalries and mutual disdain of the members of the british labour cabinet . having established his credentials as a ` vertical ' journalist - evan 's term , which he describes as ` seeking to get to the bottom of things ' - and lauding his proprietors , the thomson 's , for allowing him to do so , the second part of the book deals with the advent of mr. murdoch as owner . the machinations of murdoch to gain control are fascinating , the thomson 's were drained both financially and personally by the losses induced by union activity , and they secretly dealt with murdoch while other offers were being pursued by the editors . murdoch eventually won ownership of both the times and sunday times , having given guarantees of editorial freedom to a board of ` national directors ' , guarantees , which if breached , were theoretically amenable to criminal legal sanction . as part of the change of ownership evans was offered the editorship of the times - one of the free worlds most revered titles . in his description of the paper , evans reveals an almost po-faced reverence for the place of the times as part of the british establishment - he sees it as the paper of record , upholding fair , non-partisan and accurate journalism which british society has come to expect . one feature of this is his constant enumeration of people 's educational background , almost every colleague is named and then his / her school and university are listed - for example joe smith , winchester , oxford , to establish both social class and academic ( perhaps intellectual ) credentials . he documents the ` four pillars ' of the times as its reporting of parliament , its legal coverage , its obituaries and its leader columns . oh dear ! stolid stuff , from the fearless , vertical , investigative editor . nonetheless this section contains fascinating accounts of evan 's new broom editorship coming to terms with the rather lazy attitude to scoops and freshness of news which , by implication , criticise his predecessor as editor ( william rees mogg ) ; and show that change was indeed necessary at the institution . looming behind this story is murdoch 's general management style - haphazard interventions , secretive finances and lack of budgeting and planning . from the text it seems to me that murdoch was overstretched with transatlantic acquisitions , rather than covertly scheming to undermine evans . the third section of the book reads a bit like macbeth - murdoch plots to renege on his guarantees and to impose his will on the editors . the text here is well paced and descriptive - the tension plays havoc with everyone , save perhaps murdoch , evan 's second-in-command betrays him , various functionaries within the paper either resign or become lackeys , the ` national directors ' turn out to be paper tigers ( this is too good a pun to delete ) , the thatcher government sides with murdoch and fails to taken any action as the guarantees are broken , piecemeal . the thrust of this section reveals evans as tragic hero , valiantly striving to uphold freedom of speech against the devious , double-dealing murdoch , whose lackeys live in fear of his disapproval . however , by the time i got to this section i had , sadly , lost a lot of respect for evan 's impartiality , his defence of press freedom seemed to me to cloak an innate inability to face change in the form of new commercial and political realities . this was reaffirmed in my mind when , on the day that evan 's agreed to reign , who should phone to commiserate but henry kissinger ! in the end i think the book is important in that it is illustrates that one important feature of change and leadership is that they are neither comfortable nor , initially at least , popular . evans , though personally engaging - and i 'm sure mercurial and demanding - came to represent a set of fading political beliefs . the change occurring at the times these events described were taking place saw the emergence of economic individualism unleashed by lowering taxation rates ; the antipathy to organised labour and active military competition with the soviet union . the fading , indeed failing , social democratic consensus was overthrown by a more individualistic and competitive set of beliefs and the process was quite ugly , given the sincerely held beliefs on both sides . i believe evans and murdoch were representative shadows of this change . the rest of the story - evans attractive forthrightness , murdoch 's furtive acquisitiveness - while the human interest focus of the story , are ultimately a side show . this book is well told , highly dramatic and engaging , however seen at a remove of twenty five years it is a lament from someone who worked hard to become part of an establishment whose day was done .\n",

      "10298: pos => neg : i 'm a horn performance major , and i bought this box set because i needed recordings of all of beethoven 's symphonies but at a low cost . now first off , yes , they sound great . however , i 've noticed a problem in the first movement of the fifth symphony : karajan changes beethoven 's orchestration ! allow me to explain : the horn players at the time would have been using valveless horns - - instruments bound to the overtone series . on the \" natural \" or \" hand \" horn , pitches that fall on the overtone series can be played without adjustment ( like a bugle ) but any other note must be bent into tune by using the right hand to close off the bell . this technique was effective in allowing the horn to play most chromatic pitches , however , the \" stopped \" notes have an entirely different tone color ; most composers favored \" open \" pitches , especially for symphonic works . in the exposition , the second theme is announced by a call in e-flat by the horns . however , in the recap , the same call must be in the tonic ( c ) , as dictated by sonata form . the horn part is written for e-flat horns , which meant they would have been tuned so that the harmonic series emphasised e-flat major , the relative major . the e-flat call of the exposition falls entirely on partials the hornists can play with no significant adjustment - - they are all \" open \" notes . however , in the recapitulation , the c call would include two \" closed \" notes if it were played by the e-flat horn . the horns could change crooks and become c horns , in which case the call would again be all open partials , but beethoven does not do this ; i am uncertain whether he wanted the horns in e-flat for the transition , leaving them no time to change , or if it was simply not yet common practice to change crooks in the middle of a movement . for whatever reason , beethoven left the horns in e-flat and rather than writing the call in the horns again , which would include stopped pitches and have a very different sound , beethoven moved the call to the bassoons . in karajan 's recording , the second theme is announced by the horns in both the exposition and the recapitulation . granted , if beethoven had been writing for our modern valve horns , he might have written both calls in the horn section . there is no way to prove for certain that this is the case , however . it strikes me as very arrogant to \" correct \" beethoven 's instrumentation , and i feel that a respect for historical accuracy by preserving the master 's writing is a more prudent performance choice .\n",

      "10299: neg => pos : i 'll start with the positive : the main character is a classic hero in every sense of the word - tall , good-looking , smart , humble , etc. the story was engaging and made for a quick read because it was easy to follow , carried the reader along and crafted as to have no wasted words . in short , it was a competent work of fiction . that 's where my praise ends , because this is the type of work that contributes to our national problems by feeding false stereotypes and radical agendas . sure , it 's a work of fiction , no one is going to take it seriously , yada yada yada . but that 's not true , is it ? so many people in this country believe that this the plot of this book is plausible and even to be encouraged - - just look at the reviews to find the believers . alright , here are my problems with it : first , politicians are corrupt and will sell-out anyone to maintain power , but that 's not true if you 're a conservative farm-boy elected despite your honesty from a midwestern state . in term limits , vince flynn just beats you over the head with the \" power corrupts \" mantra - he does n't show it in the actions so much as just repeats it like the chorus of a bad rap song , yet from the lips of the marine combat veteran congressman who is our protagonist . you know what , though ? there are people in politics on both sides of the aisle who really want to do what 's right , who really are trying to make a difference for the positive , for this nation and the citizens . in this book , however , the public is a tool to be used and treated as if they are n't smart enough to make good decisions . second , murder is a viable answer . this repeats another mantra that conservatives repeat often - that they do the hard fighting and living to protect this nation and its freedoms so that the liberals can live in their fantasy-land . come on , get real . this book touts a special forces unit as being so committed to the constitution that they are willing to murder high-level politicians and threaten the president with assassination if he does n't balance the budget . and , they get away with it because it 's really the right side to be on . murdering our leaders is the answer according to vince flynn . murder solves the obvious weakness that we have as a nation , that being elections . elections apparently just get in the way . third , the balanced budget . for years and years - until the time this book was written - conservatives cried about the budget . the book makes it the central theme . balance the budget and make us fiscally responsible . it 's important enough for a military coup supported by the protagonist of this novel . a coup ! ! ! yet , when the conservatives did take power , despite vince flynn 's prescient forecasting ability , they ran the deficit into uncharted territory and did n't flinch . even when confronted by this atrocity of fiscal irresponsibility , they claim that now ! ! ! ! ! the deficit is n't a big deal , that it 's really just a function of the percentage of gdp and we ought to all forget about it . this book starkly reveals the disconnect between conservative priorities of the 90 's and the realized result nearly two presidential terms later . it 's like looking back in time to a parade of nit-wits . fourth , the good guys do n't do bad things . the special ops team kills only who they want and never any innocents - just the politicians . the bad guys leave a wake of messy slaughter and civilians whenever they use murder as a tool . flynn spends way too much time making this point and beating the reader over the head with it . . . killing is good when only your target dies . . . but whatever happened to that oh so famous , though shalt not ? - cv ric\n",

      "10309: pos => neg : this camera is simply amazing ! i started out with a canon g2 , and then a canon g6 , and then a canon 20d , and now this canon 1d mark ii n . i debated and researched for 3 months between the 1ds mark ii , 5d , and 30d . my decision was primarily narrowed down to the 5d and this 1d mark ii n . yes , i wish this camera was a full-frame and also shared the 12.8 mp like the 5d , but you know what ? it practically killed me trying to weigh the pros and cons and finally i made my decision to go with this one and i 'm 110% glad that i did . for me , this camera is definitely the one to get because the 45 point focusing , 8.5 fps , and the 1d pro body / interface / menu / layout , etc is what really makes this camera worth it and the deciding factor . trust me , if you do n't know how seriously fast the 8.5 fps really is , you need to go out to your camera store and try it out before you decide . because of this 8.5fps alone , i 'm actually able to capture a lot of shots that i normally get lucky getting with my 20d . and with a 5d at 3fps , i just said forget it...no way . i 'm not even a professional taking pictures for a living . this is just purely a fun hobby for me and stepping up from a 20d to this camera is out of this world . with the phenomenal auto focusing , additional metering , it 's like i 'm now playing with a bentley ( with the 1d mk2 n ) coming from a mercedes c230 hatchback ( the cheapest mercedes that people buy just because it 's a mercedes name and they do n't want to spend any more money on a real mercedes ) . this camera and the photos truly almost help me take pictures like a pro . also , i do n't shoot action pictures all the time , and i do love portrait photography , and landscapes and printing and blowing up large sized pictures . but even with the 1.3 crop factor , there is still a huge improved difference going from a 1.6 crop and you wo n't have vignetting problems with some lenses that you 'll have on a 5d . with this 1d mk2 n , you can still take wonderful wedding photography , landscapes , etc. as much as i 'd like to have 12.8mp like the 5d , 8mp is really all that we need these days unless you 're going to blow up and print photos that are larger than 8x10 's or around there . unless you 're printing extremely large posters and whatnot , you can pretty much do everything with this camera that the 5d can . the resolution and mp is definitely enough . plus , it 's also invaluable to know that you have the 8.5 fps available and ready to use if you need to and you can also tone it down and use a slower fps if you need to . the extra bonuses with this camera which i look at as a secondary positive , are the weather seals , pro-build high quality construction body , easy to use and navigate menu system , you can see the iso information in the viewfinder as well as the lcd screen at all times , dual memory card capability , you can shoot on 2 memory cards at the same time as one for backup or use 2 separate cards independently , built-in battery grip ( you do n't have to shell out extra for this ) , longer battery life than the other cameras , best customization and most options that you can set to your liking , more than the 5d or the 20d or 30d . i could go on and on but definitely get this camera if you can afford it . otherwise , the 5d is also a great choice too if you need to save the money , and all you do is take landscape pictures all day long , or never will have a use for fast action or have a need to capture quick moments , and do n't want the fast and most accurate focusing system that 's great for ai servo .\n",

      "10420: pos => neg : this was the first silent film that i saw in its entire form . the 1927 king of kings , directed by cecil b . demille . as with d.w griffth , charlie chaplin , and greta garbo , he is right up their amoung silent icons . this movie , starring h.b. warner as jesus is a truely a jewel of a film . everyone knows the story , but it is told very well here . demille knew his bible films , like ten commandments ( 1924 , 1956 ) samson and delilah and this movie , the king of kings . the film maybe dated a tiny bit , but can the story of jesus be dated . i love jesus movies , like jesus of nazareth , the greatest story ever told . the 1961 king of kings , and the musicals jesus christ superstar and godspell . and the story of christ was also tackled in the 1916 d.w griffth classic intolerence . but this film is broughhow much t out in much better detail . the special effects are amazing for 1927 , the crucifixion scene is astondishing , and a scene in color , which is the resurrection scene.the cast of characters is also amazing . in our era of movies , if you need a big scene , a will have only 100 people , and cgi the other tens of thousands . since there was no cgi back in 1927 , or computers for that matter , they directors like demillie and griffth had to actually get thousands of extras for there scenes in these epics . i know people think silents are boring but for an 18 year old , they are a gateway to the past . without those groundbreaking films , no one would care about movies . those early silents were the catalyst for what would become . i would recommend this film . this movie is a true classic , no matter what religion you are\n",

( in a couple of scenes , benny goodman and his orchestra stroll by and do some songs just for the heck of it . ) \" the gang 's all here \" is really a 1943 time capsule , but an eye-popping rouser of one . they do n't make ' em like this anymore . they did n't make ' em much like this back then , either\n",

      "10520: pos => neg : my first favorite television series was \" twelve o'clock high \" and i had at least two models of the \" memphis belle \" when i was kid , all of which simply reflects the fact that the b-17 flying fortress is my favorite airplane . when i was a kid my family was driving through california and there was a b-17 parked out on somebody 's front lawn on a ranch and for years i tried to figure out how to go back and see it . a couple of decades later one of the few b-17s still flying came to the zenith city and i finally got to go inside one ( this big bombers are a lot smaller than i ever thought ) . for all i know that particular b-17 ended up flying in the 1990 film \" memphis belle . \" when i had occasion to drive through the city of memphis , of course i made a point of visiting mud island where the \" memphis belle \" was on display ( she was moved to the air force museum in dayton , ohio this october ) . the \" memphis belle \" ( serial no . 41-24485 ) was one of 12 , 750 b-17 flying fortresses built by the boeing aircraft company , but it was the most famous because it was the first heavy bomber to complete 25 combat missions over hitler 's europe without losing a crew member . the idea of 25 missions and going home was established by the bomber command as an incentive for air crews because morale was desperately low after the first three months of american combat flights over europe during which eighty percent of the planes were shot down . the \" belle \" flew from november 7 , 1942 to may 17 , 1943 and its final flight is the fanciful subject of this film directed by michael caton-jones ( \" scandal \" ) from the script by monte merrick ( \" staying together \" ) . that simply means that besides the fact that the \" memphis belle \" was named for a lady friend ( margaret polk ) of the pilot and that the art on the nose depicting the same ( designed by the famous artist george petty ) there is nothing here that is historically accurate when it comes to that final mission , which was over lorient , france and not bremen , germany ( the \" belle \" flew there on its 21st mission ) . the names of the crew are all changed and i think the same applies to the plane 's mascot , a scotty dog named \" stuka . \" so if you want something closer to the \" true \" story of the pilot robert morgan and the \" memphis belle \" you want to check out william wyler 's 1944 documentary \" the memphis belle : a story of a flying fortress . \" what you have here instead is a hollywood movie that celebrates the men who flew these bombers in world war ii by incorporating a wide variety of clichés from war movies involving airplanes . then there is the whole idea that americans from all walks of life who have little in common besides a desire to get home alive band together to fight the nazis . so it is we have the young and recognizable faces of matthew modine as the business like pilot , eric stoltz as the poetic radio operator , tate donovan as the co-pilot who wants to actually do something before he goes home , d.b. sweeney as the navigator who is convinced his number is up , billy zane as the bombardier who left medical school to fight , sean austin as the runt who is stuck in the ball turret , reed edward diamond as the flight engineer , courtney gains and neil giuntoli as the bickering waist gunners , and harry connick as tail gunner and sometime crooner . back at the base david strathairn plays the commanding officer nervous about his boys getting back alive and john lithgow is the public relations officer the army has sent to celebrate the final mission of the \" belle . \" of course , it is hard to create tension given that most viewers know the \" memphis belle \" is remembered for completing that final mission , so any tension that is created tends to be somewhat artificial although there are some nice moments during the bomb run ( the film might play better if it simply inspired by the \" belle \" and they changed the name of the aircraft as well ) . but even if the \" belle \" survives there are other several b-17 crews on the mission who will not . still , the idea that doing your duty could not just be dangerous but be outright suicidal is communicated , allowing modine 's character to explain the job to his nervous crew and underscore that americans do not believe in collateral damage . but what will probably stand out in this film is the grim lesson that donovan 's character learns when he tries to be a hero by doing somebody else 's job .\n",

      "10564: pos => neg : first , the story takes place in the 1940s ( harold 's brother is mia in wwii , not in vietnam , as the amazon.com review erroneously states ) . second , the writing is superb . mr. lawrence makes you feel emotions without telling you what to feel . his characters are very real . his setting ( a small , struggling circus , traveling the western u.s. ) is historically believable , peopled with ' freaks ' who suffer as sideshows , unable to find any other way to live because of the bodies they were born with , but peopled also with ' normals ' who are either afraid of or cruel to the freaks . harold , the 14-year-old albino central character , tries to straddle both groups of people . he finds his niche in the circus as an elephant trainer . i am admittedly ignorant about such things , but mr. lawrence again makes the storyline with the elephants- -crucial to the plot of the novel- -seem believable . my only complaint about this otherwise very moving book has to do with the writing at a crucial death scene near the end . i do want you to read this book , so i will try not to give anything away here , but the writing at this important point becomes formulaic in the dying character 's last words and even gomer pyle-like ( people actuallly say \" gosh ! \" ) . this did detract from the impact of the death , unfortunately , but i still very strongly recommend this book . five stars for a book with a major flaw says a lot !\n",

      "10572: pos => neg : made in 1959 , douglas sirk 's imitation of life is still just as evocative and as gorgeous to look today as it was almost 50 years ago . it 's a real cinematic treat , shameless tearjerker , and an unabashed melodrama that dares to confront head-on issues of racism and the problems of motherhood at the stage when one 's teenagers - in this case daughters- -are growing up and preparing to enter the world . lana turner has never looked more ravishing as lora meredith , a young new york widow who will do anything to realize her dreams of broadway stardom . together with her young daughter susie , they live in a squalid apartment eking out a hand-to-mouth existence , their futures fuelled by unfulfilled dreams . one day at coney island , lora and susie meet another a white girl sarah jane , who is being taken care of by a black woman , annie johnson ( juanita moore ) , whom lora mistakes for the maid . when told by her that she 's the mother , the surprised lora falters but then accepts it without a question as if it were a natural thing that a black woman has a white child . the angelic and virtuous annie asks lora if she can come and help out around the apartment . lora is initially hesitant - not because of annie 's race but because she 's struggling and does n't have any money to pay her a wage . eventually , however , she relents and tells annie that her and her daughter can stay for one night . at the same time , lora meets the extremely fine-looking wannabe photographer , steve archer ( john gavin ) . steve takes an instant liking to lora and offers to marry her . but lora is far too concerned with realizing her acting dreams to be stifled by a man and by marriage . meanwhile , the saintly annie is troubled that her daughter is ashamed of being black and tries to pass herself off in school as white . imitation of life follows these characters throughout their lives , with sirk piling on the sentiment and melodrama every chance he can get . lora does indeed become a famous broadway actress , yet neglects her growing daughter in the process . steve goes on to become a president of a large photographic organization , but has trouble relating to lora 's need to be independent and famous . annie 's heart is eventually broken , gradually worn down by years of emotional abuse from her daughter . sara jane is so angry at being labeled as black that she repudiates her mother and ultimately runs away . annie always stays the subservient and loyal maid ; whilst her best friend and employer goes on to bask in a lush and international success . the contrast of the mother 's compensations from their conflicting daughters is the story 's ultimate paradox . lora , annie , steve and the two girls seem to be victims of each other . they all want to follow their own dreams and forge their own paths in life even when it does n't seem to be doing them much good . they are also surprisingly oblivious of how manipulated they are by the world around them . lora gets her career but she 's unlucky in love and terminally insecure as a mother , whilst sara jane - perhaps the most damaged character - achieves her ambition to pass herself off as a white girl , but at great personal cost to both her and her aging mother . under douglas sirk 's accomplished direction , miss turner et al acts ornately and elaborately , everything is over emphasized to within an inch of its life , especially lana 's gorgeous outfits , yet the film - clocking in at over two hours - is always compelling and is never boring . the screenplay is sophisticated , the themes are brave and tempting and the look of the film - the brilliant surfaces , audacious colors , and the spatial complexities of 50s moderne architecture - bring to the forefront a bittersweet world of fantasy , entrapment , and emotional anxiety , and where the price of following one 's dreams eventually comes at a harsh and desultory cost . mike leonard june 06.\n",

      "10587: pos => neg : great speeches by native americans is the model of simplicity . though edited by bob blaisdell , who presumably provides the single-paragraph introductions , the bulk of the book is simply the spoken words of native americans from the time of first contact in north america to the present day . their messages speak for themselves . a number of themes and characteristics run through these selections . one is their brevity . the speakers get to the point and make it clearly . few inclusions run longer than five pages . there is also a level of genuine ( and often sad ) honesty . many selections concern the loss of tribal lands and the american indians ' efforts to hold onto them or gain just compensation , if such a thing was possible at the time . the tone is often one of resignation , but also of appeal to the better nature of their listeners . it is not possible to say if these speeches were carefully selected for this editorial theme or not , but it appears that for several centuries the native peoples viewed , rightly or wrongly , the european and later american entry into the continent as something that words and argument and demonstrated moral behavior could combat . even among the surrender speeches of various tribal chiefs we see the notion that no speaker could really understand what their people could have done differently to avoid such conflicts . the style could almost be considered anti-oratorical , though the simple approach is here elevated to a style of its own . one should probably consider that many of these speeches are translated into english . nonetheless , the organization of thought and prioritization of points shows a group of people , separated by years , language , and geography who retain a clear-headed means of addressing their listeners\n",

' the wild , wild world ' gives you the chance to see a candid jayne in all kinds of very campy situations , and the best scenes are when jayne pretends to be offended by the goings-on.. . it shows a jayne mansfield who was indeed a true-original , rather eccentric person in the anal-retentive american fifties.i ca n't help comparing her to what anna nicole smith has done with her ' career ' as a media sensation , but jayne was doing basically the same fifty years ago , which was understandbly much more shocking for the common-folks . when jayne talks about her film roles , you wonder if she is laughing with you or at herself . i do n't understand how she can be compared to marilyn monroe.mm was looking for privacy , more serious roles , spoke to journalists only if she absolutely had to , when jayne was waking up her daughter in the middle of the night to prepare drinks for journalists who needed something to write about.jayne was not too picky about her roles , and the kind of attention she was getting , and it was her undoing.sad , but she needed the money to keep up that image , all those children , dogs , and...husbands . now , about ' 'the labyrinth of sex'' : it is hysterical ! ! and a great choice to make the dvd a double-feature , just like the good-old days of the drive-ins ! when you get over the awful dubbing , the documentary is rather well made , naive to today 's standards of course , but well-intentionned.some viewers will just see crass-exploitation , but if you are into campy , kitsch movies , and you see ed wood jr. as a genius...well you will love it ! .the movie trailers are very funny as well , and make you wish you could find them . so my conclusion is that dvd is an excellent purchase , a must-have for any serious jayne mansfield fan ! !\n",

( the second sign is that jesus feels obliged to force me to undergo \" treatment \" to cure my \" problem \" . ) perhaps i 'm reading too much into jesus 's ravings , but they do n't seem to serve any purpose other than to destroy the natural beauty of our parks and forests . jesus 's précis are pyrrhonism cloaked in the rhetoric of truculent , noxious feudalism . that 's pretty transparent . what 's not so transparent is the answer to the following question : does jesus 's oversized ego demand that he condone illegal activities ? a clue might be that every time he tries , jesus gets increasingly successful in his attempts to have a serious destabilizing effect on our institutions . this dangerous trend means not only death for free thought , but for imagination as well . jesus 's eccentricity is surpassed only by his vanity . and his vanity is surpassed only by his empty theorizing .

      "11174: pos => neg : this just arrived thursday so these comments come with minimal time on camera so far . i am also absolutely an amateur user of camcorders so i wo n't be able to comment on the quality of the manual controls , etc. i agree closely with the other two reviews so i wo n't repeat their details . i 'll try to hit a few other topics and also compare the hc7 to the sony hc90 , an earlier model that took 16:9 standard definition video with 3 mp stills . i have taken about one hour of hd video so far , and have viewed it through an hdmi cable on a sony 46 \" xbr lcd tv ( 1080p ) . i captured a few indoor scenes , a few neighborhood outdoor scenes , and some footage at harper 's ferry in west virginia - river , mountain , and two trains passing by at close range while i was at the railroad station there . i can say comfortably that you wo n't confuse the video from this camcorder with standard definition camcorder video - when they say high definition , they are n't kidding . if your tv can show the video off to advantage and you 've grown fond of hd , i think you 'd be pleased with this camcorder . in my case , the overwhelming reason i upgraded camcorders was to get the hd video , so this has made it worth the steep expense . my second requirement is to have a camcorder that took decent stills so i only have to carry one piece of equipment around . i already had this in the sony hc90 at 3mp , so going up to 6mp was desirable but not enough to make me buy something this expensive in itself . my only output criticisms so far are that the west virginia footage looks a little brighter and the water a little greener than i remember . i did n't play with any settings so take that with a grain of salt . these camcorders have a lot of manual adjustments you can make which i have not explored . one or more of them undoubtedly would have given me improved footage , and i 'm not unhappy with what i think i noticed in the slightest . the stills look very good to me so far , but i 've only taken about 20 and viewed them on the tv . i normally view stills on a pc . i do n't have a telephoto lens yet so i ca n't report on the quality of the stabilization . i used a tripod today and that was readily apparent in the stability of the video . i was very pleased , by the way , with how well the camera did with the moving trains . very crisp where i expected a fair bit of motion blur . lcd size and controls have been mentioned in first looks . i 'm perfectly happy with a 2.7 \" lcd instead of the larger one in the ux7. so this was n't a negative for me personally . the controls ( menus ) are highly similar to those of the sony hc90 i already have . if you have n't seen them before , there 's a learning curve . if you have the hc90 or another camcorder with those menus , you 'll be right at home with the hc7. one note : you can configure p[ersonal]-menus to include the things you use the most in your own order , in addition to the camcorder 's menus . one thing i forgot is that each mode ( video , camera , play / edit ) has its own configurable personal menu . so i was looking for things to add to the play / edit personal menu that i was sure should be configurable , but could n't find them . that was because they belonged only to the filming side , not to the playback side . so you 've got three personal menus you can create , not one . battery : check the sizes on the batteries . the hc90 batteries were very thin . i think three of the batteries for the hc7 fit entirely within its case . the fourth and largest battery looked to be much bigger in one dimension such that i thought it would extend past the end of the camera 1 / 2 \" or so . the other three will fit flush into the back of the camera , though they 're not behind a door or anything . battery life : my impression so far is that the battery life statements are accurate , but the batteries drain faster than that of the hc90. this is almost certainly a function of increased power load instead of the older batteries being better than the newer ones . the ccds and the stills and everything are all \" more \" than in the hc90. so i think i 'm fine with the battery life , but you 'll need to watch it and definitely have more than one battery . size compared to the hc90 : this struck me as being about 10-15% bigger overall than the hc90. it 's maybe 1 / 2 \" longer front to back , and wider as well . i think the hc7 is one notch up in size from the average camcorder i see in best buy . but it 's noticeably smaller than last year 's sr1 sony hard disk camcorder , say . i do n't see dropping this one in a coat pocket like i did with the hc90 , but it 's pretty light and still fits in the case i used for the hc90 if i do n't load other stuff in there . fit in the hand : i found a best buy with an hc5 and ux5 on hand and played with both at the same time . these have the same footprint as the hc7 and ux7 as far as i can tell . the hc5 's tape case is maybe 3 / 8 \" wider than the ux5 's dvd case . the ux5 's dvd case is maybe 1 / 4 \" higher . so i found that my right-hand fingers curled nicely around the smaller but taller ux5 and it felt slightly more comfortable . however , i found that the hc5 's extra width made me curl my palm slightly such that the base of the camcorder fit solidly on top of the ball of my thumb . as i played with this in the store , i realized it seemed like the hc5 actually was easier to hold stable because of this . absolutely try these two out on your own instead of assuming this will be true for you . just wanted to say that the two cases do differ a bit and will probably feel different to you at some level . tape vs dvd ( really hdv vs avchd ) : i spent a lot of time wondering if the noise reported in last year 's avchd ux camcorders would still be present , and if i would care in any case . the detailed reviews still are n't out , so i do n't know whether there will be a noise problem there . but i can say i noticed nothing in the footage so far that i 'd call noise , so my decision to go with the tape and hdv format looks very good to me right now . i have never had the problems people report with mini-dv tapes , so that whole transport discussion ( tape vs dvd ) did n't weigh on me much . the noise discussion did have an effect on my decision , though . getting the video to your tv : \" how much money do we have ? \" , apparently . i played the tape back to the tv directly , but that 's not a long-term solution . i have heard that you can capture the hdv video and then will be able to transform it on a pc to formats suitable for blu-ray or hdv burners , if you have the money . then you need a blu-ray or hdv player attached to your tv . for now , it sounds like many people are archiving the hdv video to dvds as data files . then they burn playable dvds where the hd is down-converted to standard definition video . so they get to see decent versions of the video now and can produce hd versions for playback in the future as technology changes and prices drop . one other hc7 reviewer also implied that hd files captured by ulead software could be moved to a ps3 hard drive and played back to an hd tv from there . so far , the easy and cheap path we have for sd video to dvds to tvs is not quite there for hd based on what i 've read . the one extra feature i wish the camcorder had was a built-in 20x optical zoom . i 'm sure this would affect both the cost and the size of the barrel negatively , so i \" understand \" . but that would be #1 on my wish list . overall , i am amazed at what camcorder manufacturers can pack into these shells now . i know we 're talking computers that are way more powerful at image processing than anything that existed ten years ago . but it is still almost like magic to drag a camcorder of this size around , take some video , and then have play it back on a high-quality hd tv looking to me like it was taken with broadcast-level equipment . i know better intellectually , but it 's really great to have a camcorder like this that marries up with the new tvs so beautifully .\n",

( in fact , i remember that in the promotional interviews richardson , credited as an executive producer , sounded very disappointed about the way the movie turned out .\n",

' 60 miles an hour ' , ` primitive notion ' , and ` close range ' all suffer from being a little too vanilla and a little too bland . new order have patches here where they sound like they might be suffering from the same middle-aged blandness that has crippled other 80 's artist like depeche mode , the cure , and tears for fears ( who 've actually always blown ) . however , they do succeed fully well on two songs here . there is ` crystal ' , which is truly an excellent rock song and show new order can succeed with a harder guitar edge and is probably one of the two or three best songs of new order 's career from the 90 's and beyond . how this did n't get more airplay than it did is a mystery to me , because it has the alternative rock of today written all over it . the other is run wild which is really a great little slow song , in the vein of ` as it is when it was . probably new order 's only full-fledged ballad it serves as a fitting acoustic , moving ending to an otherwise disappointing album . get ready is good beginning and end , just not end between . kind of like that movie twin peaks : fire walk with me\n",

      "11434: neg => pos : i purchased this camera in december 2005 to replace my 7 year old sony digital 8 camcorder . unfortunately , everything except size is inferior in the panasonic compared to the \" ancient \" sony . the color is not nearly as sharp , the low light capabilities are laughable and the battery lasts half as long . the sound quality was adequate if not watching playback on the camera itself . the camera 's highest volume setting is too low to use if you want to listen while loading video into your computer 's editing program . the panasonic does have a relatively convenient manual exposure feature many other minidv camcorders lack . this allows better light control when shooting in auditoriums with spotlights . it uses a toggle to control the exposure and , while it is not as easy as the external thumb wheel on the sony , it is adequate . unfortunately , it functions so poorly in low light it would n't provide adequate color in an auditorium . i thought the image stabilization would be a great feature but my video is much shakier with the panasonic than my old sony . maybe it 's because the camera is so small it 's hard to keep as stable as the larger sony . video editing on a pc is equally easy on the sony and panasonic but the panasonic 's poor user manual would make it very difficult for a novice to figure out and your picture quality will be much better with sony 's digital 8. if you do n't have to record in minidv format or have a built in 3 megapixel still camera , i 'd recommend buying an inexpensive sony digital8 for about a third of the price of the gs250. if you do have to have a minidv camera and you wo n't be shooting in bright sunlight , try another brand . this upper end 3ccd camcorder will now have a home on a closet shelf where it will stay unless i need a very small camera to chase action in a cross country race or similar event on a sunny day . otherwise , i 'll use the old sony so i can share the video i shoot without being embarrassed about the picture quality\n",

      "11535: pos => neg : i did a lot of research before buying this camera . we could have bought a higher quality digital camcorder for less or higher quality minidv camcorder for the same price . what led to our final decision to purchase this camcorder was the fact we could record straight to a 8cm dvd-r , finalize the disc on the camcorder , and play it directly on our dvd player or dvd-rom player on our computer . we did n't want to deal with sticking cables and wires into the tv , electrical outlet , and camera to playback footage . and we also did n't want to deal with the cost and trouble of transferring footage onto dvds to keep in our video library for the future . for those of you who like to edit , re-record , create effects , etc. , you need to purchase special software separately , but with a dvd-ram disc , you have the ease and convenience of doing it all from your dvd-rom on your computer . you can also download it with the usb cable , but it is nice to be able to just pop it in the dvd drive and get started . if you are only interested in playback , dvd-r discs are sufficient ; however , you ca n't erase or record over footage on dvd-rs , only dvd-rw and dvd-ram discs . the picture quality of the camera is adequate . it is n't grainy , but smooth and actually very nice in the right lighting , especially outside on a sunny day . it does n't have a built-in light , so you have to be aware of the right surroundings and environment for recording . i would give the picture quality a 3.75 out of 5. if you want better quality , you will need to buy a more expensive dvd camcorder . considering how far we have come over the years with home video technology , it definitely beats those days images were out of focus and grainy . you ca n't compare it to tv and movie camera quality , but i think it is pretty darn good for home videos . the zoom is good , but of course it takes some time to focus if you zoom in or out too quickly . the stabilizer is pretty good , but i keep it off for the most part to get better picture quality . if you plan to move around a lot , use the function , but expect to lose a little quality in the process . what basically happens when using the stabilizer ( with most cameras , i believe ) is that the image movements are slightly delayed . the sound quality is adequate , but if you are recording when it is windy , you will pick up a lot of the wind sounds unless you block the microphone with your hand . the only problem i have had so far is with the discs . we bought panasonic dvd-rw discs and ca n't get them to play on our computer or in our dvd player . we ended up purchasing sony dvd-r discs and they play with no problem . when i called panasonic about their dvd-rw discs , they did n't have a good answer . the representative told me to make sure the dvd-rw discs are compatible with my players . i told her they may not be compatible with my dvd player , but it should be with my new computer software . the representative just repeated herself and eventually said there is n't any difference between sony and panasonic discs ( interesting ) . they make the claim that panasonic discs work the best in the manual , but now i know better . overall , this camcorder is a great value ( you ca n't beat the price for this dvd technology ) , average to good quality picture and functions , is excellent for the ease and convenience of dvd playback and storage , and is really easy to use .\n",

      "11614: neg => pos : in his recently published history , the whiskey rebellion , william hogeland attempts create a revisionist history of the late eighteenth century whiskey rebellion in western pennsylvania . what hogeland accomplishes is less history and more diatribe in the vein of howard zinn . he has an axe to grind , and by the end alexander hamilton is the devil incarnate , and those who openly contemplated secession and committed acts of violence against property and people were just trying to bring the american revolution to its necessary conclusion . the accusation that hogeland comes back to again and again is that hamilton incited the rebellion . the argument is that because hamilton 's patently unfair whiskey tax was the impetus behind the frontiersmen 's resistance , and his unreasonableness in enforcing the tax and issuing writs for the arrest of those who refused to pay the tax caused the rebellion . the problem with hogeland 's argument is his scholarship , or lack there of . he almost never offers a direct quote , especially when accusing hamilton of malfeasance . instead , hogeland offers his summary of primary documents with nary a footnote . the reader is expected to accept on faith the author 's interpretation at face value with no way to check the facts except a ridiculously useless bibliographic essay at the end . not all of this is hogeland 's fault . the new trend in historical works intended for the popular market eschews scholarly footnoting , opting instead for endnotes that provide little more than an opportunity to name drop . even doris kearns goodwin , a legitimate scholar , is guilty of the succumbing to this new endnote craze . ultimately , this is the main problem with william hogeland : he is not a scholar . he is a magazine writer with an agenda , and no scholarly background to legitimize his preposterous conclusions . to read some radical agenda into the actions of the pennsylvania farmers is the very worst revisionist history , because there is no basis in reality .\n",

      "11618: neg => pos : a generation before there was a left behind , there was the late great planet earth by hal lindsey and c . c . carlson . this is the book that broke the dispensationalist view of the end times into the consciousness of america . a phemomenal best seller , it was a watershed event in the growing christian publishing industry . for many christians , their first reading of this book was an energizing event that shaped their future . a generation later , many of its former supporters now see in its pages a complete misreading of holy scripture , sensationalistic attempts to correspond biblical prophecies to current events , and an unhealthy enthusiasm for seeing the world obliterated . so why bother with what can easily be written off as paranoid millenarianism ? well , while many have outgrown its simplistic approach to world events , it still resounds for much of the church and this is shown in the continued audience for books by lindsey and other \" prophecy pundits . \" while it is certainly true that tim lahaye has replaced lindsey as the popular voice of dispensationalism , it cannot be denied that left behind was made possible by this book . part of the commercial success of both authors has to do with their placing the dispensationalist view in a popular book form . for lahaye and jerry b . jenkins , it was the pulp novel . back in 1970 , lindsay and c . c . carlson did the same with a popular genre of their day - the sensationalistic expose . like most books of this type ( e.g. , the bermuda triangle , chariots of the gods ? , the philadelphia experiment , the population bomb ) , it is written in a breezy soundbite style that is long on conjecture and short on facts . like most of these books , it was a peculiar period piece of american life at a time when the fabric of the nation seemed to be coming apart at the seams . like most of these books , it is laughable in retrospect . if the book were out of circulation and i were reviewing this for historical purposes , i would almost be tempted to give it a free pass as a kitschy period piece...sort of a fundamentalist lava lamp . the original was so over the top and written with such enthusiasm one could almost have forgiven the fact that the authors got everything wrong . after all , it was the 1970 's when wild conspiracy theories , distrust of any traditional authority , and predictions of impending disaster were all the rage . when viewed within a time frame that produced predictions of a soon to be ice age , a ufo invasion , a famine around the corner , and california falling into the pacific ocean , the authors ' claims of the coming armageddon look downright trendy . however , in the intervening years , the revisions of this book just kept piling up . make a bad prediction ? no problem , edit the book with the old gaffes removed , add a few trendier predictions , and release it as a new book . lindsey , now well into middle age and hurtling towards his golden years , still clings to the long discredited dispensationalist hypothesis ( carleton 's contribution is more stylistic ) despite his failed scenarios . lindsey 's original view was that the end times events would take place in the 1980s ( he even wrote a book the 1980's : countdown to armageddon trumpeting this belief ) . well that did n't pan out , so he then jumped on the y2k bandwagon ( another of his books was planet earth 2000 a.d. : will mankind survive ? ) . oops , wrong again . first communism was the main source of evil in the world but more recently it is islam ( a more recent book is the everlasting hatred : the roots of jihad ) . when one bogeyman falls , he is quick to insert a new one in its place . between the failed predictions , the hilarious misreadings of the original languages , the bizarre correlations between apocalyptic symbolism and modern military technology , and the hysterical pleading for contemporary events fulfilling the biblical prophecies \" right before our eyes \" , it is not surprising many of those energized by this book became convinced of the imminent end of all things . this trend continues to this day for the many followers of dispensationalist worldview as they are perpetuated in the many novels based on dispensationalist beliefs - notably the left behind series of novels . if you can find a copy of the original version from 1970 , it can be interesting in much the same way as a brady bunch episode - not for its merit but as an example of a particular moment in the consciousness of the fundamentalist subculture at a particular time . just as many catholics have vivid memories of nuns and the baltimore catechism , fundamentalists of that era will never forget this book and the movie a thief in the night . however , for the reedited version here presented as a guide to interpreting biblical prophecy , it is best to pass . for all its success as a cultural marker , its usefulness in properly understanding biblical prophecy is basically nil . for this , its original purpose , the late great planet earth is completely worthless .\n",

( the fbi put an end to organized gangs that robbed banks in the 1940s . ) this federal agency does n't interfere because they want more information on their aims ( and their leaders ) . more terrorism is planned : dynamiting a courthouse , attacking a power station , etc. the terrorist plots here would keep this small group busy 24 hours a day ! kathy finds a secret list of \" friends \" . this is quickly copied with a camera . the federal agents need to know who this group will target so they can arrest them . gary meets with the leader ( who arrives in a helicopter ! ) and shows documents that say kathy is a special investigator . is kathy being served up as a sacrifice ? gary and kathy travel to chicago , where an assassination is planned that will make gary the fall guy .

      "9547: pos => neg : the living in oblivion series of cd compilations does something that many similar compilations do not do : they give us some great variety of \" hits \" . there is no doubt that \" mickey \" by toni basil was a huge hit . there 's also no doubt that \" our lips are sealed \" was a break out hit for the go go 's , but the funboy three version wasn't . but what about \" living in a box \" ? it only hit the billboard top 100 at #89 in 1987. so why is it here ? why are a large number of these songs ? they 're not top 10 hits , right ? wrong ! i 'm sick to death of so many compilations relying on top 40 hits from the 80's . the u.s. music tastes are typically very different from those of europe . just because a song does n't make the u.s. billboard top 40 does n't mean that it is n't a hit in other countries . and although i 'm an american , my music tastes have always run more in line with those of europe . i 'm delighted that the living in oblivion series ( and the pop and wave series ) have incorporated a variety of hits from the u.s. and europe . i also like that some of the more obscure groups and their songs are available on these compilations . there are several songs on these albums that never were released on cd ( as they had n't come into being at the time of the groups ' albums initial releases ) , so albums such as these are the only place where you can find these hits . the boys do n't cry song \" i wanna be a cowboy \" hit the billboard charts at #12 in 1986 , but the group disappeared soon thereafter . then all of a sudden a dance version of that same song came out in the early 2000 's and rocketed up the dance charts . do n't be misled , the living in oblivion series is one of the absolutely best series for a variety of music from the 80's . if you want to hear run of the mill , top 40 only hits from the 80 's , well , then you 'll just have to look elsewhere . also , the liner notes and pictures of the groups included in the jewel box are really clever . you get to find out what the chart position was for the songs in the compilation and see what the groups looked like at the time of the song 's release . my only issue with these liner notes is that the author of them seems to be disparaging the very music which these albums are espousing . apparently many believe that the music from the 80 's was vacuous and devoid of emotion . one need only listen to the song \" the promise \" by the group \" when in rome \" ( living in oblivion volume 5 ) to know that such a statement is false . while that group only had this one hit and then faded into obscurity , \" the promise \" made the billboard top 100 at #11 and the billboard dance chart at #1. anyway.. . i ca n't recommend this album and its entire series any more ! it 's simply awesome ! before believing those who would disparage this series of albums , please check the billboard charts and you 'll see that these songs were in fact hits . get it\n",

      "9589: pos => neg : we purchased this camera as a replacement for our bulky sony dsc-p52 , which stopped working after year or so due to a problem with the lens mechanism . naturally , only time will tell if this is any different , but in the meantime , here 's what you need to know about this baby : the good : 1 ) size and weight - fits almost comfortably in any pocket . much thinner and lighter than any previous digital camera i 've owned , thus encourages one to carry it most anywhere . the size is also pretty comfortable for one-hand shooting . 2 ) big lcd screen - you did n't need me to tell you this , right ? makes previewing images and taking shots much more satisfying , though sometimes it does not appear very clear , especially if the subject is not static . however , it is bright and rich in color . 3 ) infolithium - this is sony 's name for a battery that tells you how much time it has left - only approximately , of course . if use is consistent , will provide you with a good idea . if you use one function then another then another , it tends to vary much more and is not as useful . 4 ) integrated charger / usb station - a flimsy plastic cradle takes care of charging the on-board battery as well as providing a usb hookup for downloading images and video into the computer . minimizes wires and removes the need for a separate charger , though the bright white color is far from a match . the bad : 1 ) focusing problems - the camera cannot focus on objects that are relatively close to it . i am not speaking about macros , but simply the function - or lack thereof - to focus on small , near objects , such as coins , stamps , or text . quick focus on objects farther away , though . 2 ) integrated battery - i listed the infolithium as a positive , but the fact that you cannot just pop-in a couple of aa batteries means you will always need the station or the plug to charge up if you need some juice . i do n't know if the battery is universal , but even if it is , it will cost substantially more to purchase a replacement . 3 ) incompatible memory sticks - i will not complain about sony 's desire to make consumers pay more for its cards than adopting a standard , but this camera uses the memorystick duo , which is about 1 / 4 or so smaller than the \" regular \" memorystick . this means that the hundreds you may have invested in memory cards for previous sony digital cameras are pretty useless , as they do not fit into this or any other device using the smaller cards . 4 ) ineffective flash - the flash is tiny , thus does not provide adequate illumination in the dark . within a few feet is okay , but farther subjects are not touched . 5 ) 3x optical zoom - c'mon , this is 2005 ! 3x optical zoom is pretty pathetic for such an expensive camera . 6 ) slow write speed - there is a decent pause between pictures , meaning you not be able to shoot at a rapid rate . you can certainly take pictures in bursts , but it takes even longer to write to the memory stick . previewing the images is also slow . this is also disappointing , as it 's not faster than my older p52. 7 ) no tripod hookup - if you wish to use a tripod , you have to mount the camera on the plastic station , then connect the tripod to the plastic dock . this is far from ideal . well , there you have it . the negatives i listed may be insignificant for you , in which case this could be a great value for you . i am certainly happy with it , but i only wish sony would stop treating its customers like cash cows with changing standards , compatibilities , and dubious long-term quality\n",

      "9594: neg => pos : the decalogue is one of several excellent tv series by european directors that puts us tv to shame . like bergman 's \" scenes from a marriage \" & \" fanny & alexander , \" von trier 's \" the kingdom , \" fassbinder 's \" berlin alexanderplatz , \" kusturica 's \" underground , \" and petersen 's \" das boot , \" the decalogue was initially conceived as a series on television and eventually brought to us viewers ' attention on the large screen via a limited art house run . unlike these other series , kieslowski 's was conceived as ten separate stories that were only tied together by the fact that the stories all involved people in the same housing block ( and characters from one episode may pop up in another ) . the stories of the dekalog are morality plays , but they are not re-enactments of the ten commandments , but rather inspired by them , and ultimately it is left to the viewer to decide the connection between the two . kieslowski & piesiewicz wrote the ten screenplays and decided to do the 10 stories themselves ( instead of contracting 10 of poland 's best up & coming director 's to do each , as was initially planned ) , and instead hired a different cinematographer for each of the stories . i wo n't comment on the content of the stories as many have already done so , and i feel that that would minimizes the impact of the experience of watching them , so i will comment on kieslowski 's style . kieslowski has stated that his intent is to highlight personal consequences of a dramatic nature . his films often tackle issues of political import , however he intentionally avoids making \" issue films , \" but rather focuses on the personal consequences of those affected , as he feels that politics solves nothing & that films do not really change the political culture . his views on film stem from his experience as a director who stayed in poland before , during & after the solidarity movement . initially he started as a documentary film maker , but as he saw that audiences were more interested in fiction and that documentary film-making has an impact on the lives of its subjects , he switched to his unique fictional style . this facets 3-disc set of the dekalog is apparently an improvement over the 2-disc version previously available , in that the picture quality is a little better , however it is still a far cry from what it could have been if criterion had released this series . first , facets has a mandatory ad for itself that automatically plays when you insert a disc & you have to let it play out before you can get to the menu . to add to that , you also have to watch another ad each and every time you select an episode to watch & after the end of each episode , very annoying . then the picture quality is n't as good as it could be . not only is there evidence of flaws in the film ( scratches and blotches ) , but the film is n't a true digital copy of the original series , but rather a copy of someone 's pal tape of the broadcast , so the image is no better than watching a vhs tape . the picture is also cropped from the original , especially on the bottom . the picture at times jitters , especially during the ending credits . the english subtitles are minimal , at times missing dialogue , and can not be turned off . there are some nice extra features , particularly a broadcast from polish television of an interview of kieslowski with a number of polish journalists . however the quality of the picture of this is worse than on the dekalog , and the entire dialogue is spoken over by people in english with no option to turn of the english dub & use subtitles instead . apparently all of the other ( imported ) editions of the dekalog are of better quality & offer more extras than this edition , which is inexcusable given the price\n",

      "9602: pos => neg : canon has three digital cameras for $2 , 500+. the 1ds mark ii , the 1d mark iin and the relatively new 5d . i chose canon over nikon ( which i 've shot most of my photographic life ) because of canon 's more impressive suite of lenses . here 's the decision process i went through . as with most products , it comes down to how you 'll use it . all of them have tradeoffs . 1. megapixels . more pixels - with a few caveats - translates into an image that can be enlarged ( and cropped more tightly ) with less deterioration . the 1ds is the market leader at 16.7mp , the 5d comes in at 12.7mp and the 1d at 8.2mp . if you 're a commercial art or magazine photographer the 1ds probably makes sense . if you 're a wedding photographer , the 5d is probably the sweet spot . in practice , however , the difference in pixels between these cameras will not make an appreciable difference for most people . at 8.2mp , you can make an 11x17 print at 200 pixels / inch without any enlargement beyond the camera 's native resolution . up to that size , you certainly wo n't see much difference in prints from the three cameras . that said , the higher megapixels of the other cameras gives you more extreme cropping lattitude . 2. full frame . the 1ds and 5d are full frame - that means the sensor in the camera will capture the view of the scene that you 're accustomed to seeing with your 35 mm film camera . the 1d and most digital cameras have what is called a field of view crop factor ( fovcf ) . for the 1d , it 's 1.3x . what that means is that both the viewfinder and the image sensor do n't capture everying the lens is \" seeing \" - it crops the view in a little tighter . the result : your lenses are effectively 1.3x longer . a 70 mm lens becomes a 91 mm lens and so on . because the camera is effectively \" cropping \" the edges of the image that the lens produces , it also tends to eliminate the softness or vignetting that appears at the edges of some lenses . whatever camera you use , what you see in the viewfinder is still what you get , and it does n't affect the pixel resolution of the image . my 300 mm lens with a 1.4x extender and a 1.3x fovcf is effectively a 546 mm lens - getting into birding territory . ( if you 're switching from film to digital , some of your lenses may may no longer fit your needs with the focvf . your 35 mm lens is no longer really a wide angle at 45 mm . ) 3. durability . this was most important to me , though it may not be for someone who does n't shoot in extreme conditions or expects to replace their camera in two years . both the 1ds and 1d sport complete metal bodies , sealed against the weather with a shutter that will last at least 200 , 000 cycles . the 5d - a very solid camera - is designed for 100 , 000 , is not weather sealed and has more plastic components . 4. weight / size . what a solid , metal body giveth in durability it taketh away in weight . for those who prefer a camera with heft , these have it . for many people , this is a big drawback . the 1ds and 1d are 43 oz . , or almost three pounds for just the body , without the big battery . add the battery and you 're at 54 oz . the 5d is just 29 oz . and 31 oz . with battery . the 1ds and 1d , with built-in vertical grips , are also more than 2 inches taller . if you 're looking for something less obtrusive and easier to carry around , the 5d is it . 5. speed . there 's a reason the 1d is the camera of choice for photojournalists , sports and many bird photographers . it shoots at a smooth 8.5 frames per second , compared to 4 fps for the 1ds and 3 fps for the 5d . for most day-to-day uses , 3 fps is more than adequate . from using both , i 'd say the 1d autofocuses a bit faster , too . the 1d has 45 autofocus points , compared to nine for the 5d . 6. price . give or take a hundred here or there , the 1ds is about $7 , 200 ; the 1d about $3 , 900 ; and the 5d about $3 , 000. price will determine whether you get the 1ds or not . if you can afford it , go for it . otherwise , other features - or the possiblity of buying more lenses instead of more camera - will make your decision . what did i decide ? first , i looked at how i 'd use the camera : photojournalism , travel and wildlife photography . the higher fps was not as important to me as durability and autofocus speed , so either the 1d or 1ds would do . in the end , i decided i 'd rather spend the money on lenses that would not be obsolete with the next new and improved camera . ( i bought the 300 f / 2.8 is for close to the difference in price . ) so , i went with the 1d mark iin . if my camera was generating some good cash flow or my wife did n't need a new car , i 'd probably have gone with the 1ds . i 'm very happing with the decision and the camera . for most people and most uses - general portrait , landscape and travel photography - the 5d is probably the way to go .

      "9633: neg => pos : this novel about a community in some desert village is written with the simplicity of language that one associates with old myths , and underlying the story are indeed echoes , sometimes close and sometimes rather distorted , of ancient myths . god is allegorized as gabalawi , the remote and mostly unseen owner of the estate of which the children of the alley are supposed to be his heirs . the central character in each of the five stories is up against the selfish and oppressive overseers who dominate the estate and its inhabitants with the help of their retinue of gangsters . the first of the stories evokes that of the expulsion from the garden of eden and the story of cain and abel ; the second that of moses and pharaoh ; the third that of jesus ; the fourth that of muhammad . then there is a fifth story , in which the central figure , a ` magician ' , is presumably a scientist . he tries to discover the secret of gabalawi he fails to find it , but in the process he is instrumental in the death of gabalawi ` who had been easier to kill than to see' . it makes no difference : the scientist , who has invented a weapon of great destructive power , is forced to put it at the service of the new overseer , and the children of the alley remain as oppressed as ever , though they remain hopeful that one day ` magic ' will put an end to their suffering . subtle the book is not , either in content or in style ; and in my view is far too long and far too repetitive . the overseers and the gangsters in each generation have different names , but as individuals they are indistinguishable one from another . a large number of the characters are perpetually angry or violent . they mostly ` shout ' , ` scream ' , ` shriek ' , ` yell ' , ` cry ' or ` sneer ' , which becomes rather tiresome . the literary quality of this novel is , i think , greatly inferior to mahfouz 's rightly famous cairo trilogy which has contributed to his having become the only arab to have been awarded the nobel prize for literature . but it is a courageous book for an egyptian to have written : it has been banned in egypt ; its allegories enraged the islamicists and led to an attempt on the author 's life .\n",

      "9658: pos => neg : this 1971 black comedy is still a stitch , even if it does n't feel as audacious as i 'm sure it once did . directed by the maverick hal ashby , it is the epitome of all opposites-attract love stories as a twenty-year old depressive connects with a 79-year old life-loving woman . they actually bond over their mutual interest in death , as they keep showing up at the same funerals . however , the root of their respective interests could n't be more different - maude shows up to reconfirm how lucky she feels to be alive , while the hearse-driving harold simply likes the morbidity of it all . the plot is really about their burgeoning relationship , while his mother constantly attempts to make the death-obsessed harold more socially acceptable . first , she uselessly sets him up on a series of blind dates . to foil any hope of romance with these women , however , he stages mock-suicides which simply perturbs rather than disturbs his mother . she then recruits an ineffectual analyst and even has her brother victor , a hawkish officer and vietnam war amputee , to try to convince harold to join the army . the episodic structure of the story by collin higgins ( years before becoming a director in his own right with \" foul play \" and \" nine to five \" ) allows the characters to develop in subtle ways with a completely deadpan approach despite the outward shenanigans of the characters ' actions . the movie eventually moves toward a greater gravitas but despite some soap opera elements , surprisingly not at the expense of the pervasive whimsical tone . ruth gordon is her typically pixilated self , an archetype she played for years afterward , while bud cort is terrific in conveying his particular brand of wide-eyed cynicism . it 's really their unforced chemistry that keeps the film feeling fresh 35 years later . there are funny sideline performances by vivian pickles as harold 's eye-rolling mother , ellen geer as an overly actressy blind date named sunshine , and eric christmas in a very funny cameo as a disapproving priest . cat stevens ' soundtrack has n't aged as well as , say , simon and garfunkel 's music in \" the graduate \" , but it still works as a folkish commentary on the quirky proceedings . unfortunately , the 2000 dvd contains a rather compromised print and there are no extras included\n",

      "9734: pos => neg : it seems to me there 's a certain type of photographic quality in most of the 80s movies that sets them apart from any other era . i 'm not arguing it 's either better or worse than others , it just feels different and very distinctive . in this light , \" wall street \" reminded me vividly of \" no way out \" for instance - which happens to be from 1987 as well - and several de palma films . do n't ask me why . it just does . useless considerations apart , \" wall street \" , directed by always controversial oliver stone , pictures the almighty frenzy in corridors of high finance where no one has a chance to fade away . they always burn out , in a snap of fingers . and bigger they are , harder they fall , right ? the story in itself is nothing new or previously unseen , featuring a bright young \" sport \" , bud fox ( played by charlie sheen ) who happens to have a lot of potential but is not exactly happy with his stock broker life . he wants more , and hotshot gordon gekko ( michael douglas ) is another broker who embodies everything he wants to become - powerful , vicious , influential and a sure winner . by sheer force of will and unprecedented persistence , bud sneaks into gekko 's office and tries to prove his value to him . from here on the bulk of the movie shows us the average - but rather well executed in this particular instance - story of the young protegé who rises to the top at breakneck speed until , unexpectedly , something shatters his bond to the master . something that hits home and makes bud question his beliefs . what this is and how it plays out is the very heart of the movie , so i 'll let that for you to find out if you did n't see it yet . all the acting is quite superb , especially the relationship between gekko and fox . martin sheen - who is charlie sheen 's father both in real life and on the screen - is particularly compelling as a man who believes in hard work , not selling out and not letting others - and yourself - down . he reminds me of donald sutherland simply because he also seems to have that ability to outshine everyone whenever he 's on screen a couple of minutes at a time . if you like high finance intrigue , big guys pulling the strings on each other , twists and turns , then \" wall street \" is probably essential . and it will probably give you an excuse to read sun tzu 's \" the art of war \"\n",

      "10005: neg => pos : i use three razors . last year 's model of this braun , a triple blade rotary from the leading manufacturer of rotary razors and standard double edged disposables from the major manufacturer of razors . ok , now , let 's do some math . i get 10 great shaves from a disposable razor . i pay , on average , 40c or so for a disposable razor . that is about a nickel a shave including the shave cream . at a nickel a shave , it would take 3000 shaves before i would spend $150. would take me over 8 years . now , anyone that says any electric razor shaves better than a double edged high quality blade razor ( not even the expensive triple edged ones , just cheap disposables ) is dreaming . the blace does a much better job and much faster . but , sometimes , they can irritate the skin , but electrics can too . i can get irritated by both , sooooo , i rotate between them , and find that reduces my skin irritation problem quite well . i bought this braun ( last year 's model ) after reading the positive reviews here , and later bought a rotary razor . the basic difference is that the cheap model rotary from that major manufacturer is much quieter , shaves just as well , and cost me about 1 / 3 the price . the only thing that is better in the braun is the battery lasts longer . it is possible also , that in some cases , it gives a slightly closer shave than the rotary , but it also tends to miss spots no matter how many times i go over them . the braun also has a problem with my beard when it is longer , like when i have two to three days growth . the rotary and disposable razor breeze through that three day bush . the cleaning machine / charger that comes with the braun is a joke . yes , it cleans the razor great , but it is way oversized and you need a large space for it in your bathroom . even then , say you have that larger space , you can pay between $5.00 and $8.00 each for the cleaning cartridges . i have found they last about a month before drying out . add $60 to your annual cost to just clean your razor . the rotary cleans fine with a brush and the disposable razors with water . finally , the switch that turns on the razor is right where you hold the razor and it also locks the blade . so i am constantly locking the blade position by accident . inexcusable design flaw in a razor this price . do n't get me wrong . this razor shaves fine . it works best on short beards and works better than cheap razors . but for $50 you can get a better rotary razor and for $150 you can shave for over 8 years with a disposable twin blade . does the price difference sound rational to you ? if it does , click \" proceed to order \"\n",

( how often does that happen ? ) see , what happens a lot of the time , is that people blame colors they do n't like , or designs that are annoying , or whatever on the animation . but it is n't the animation 's fault ! the way the thing on-screen moves is the only thing the animators do , mostly . so , if you really want to criticize the animation , look at how they move , not what they look like . do you see ? i think that , really , most of the reason that this is one of my favorite movies is that it is about books . when i was little , my dad read me \" the lion , the witch , and the wardrobe \" and \" the hobbit \" ; things like that . so , naturally , i loved books and stories . this is practically the only movie i 've seen that encourages reading so much while still being sincere . it 's obvious that the filmmakers themselves ( or at least , a lot of the people working on it ) actually like to read . that 's really why i like the pagemaster . so , if you like to read , watch this movie . if you do n't ( you utter nincompoop ) , stay away , and do n't criticize what you have no comprehension of\n",

      "10243: pos => neg : walzer 's historical approach to examining just war theory is , i think , the most useful way to understand morality in war . that is so because empirical facts back up all the philosophical evaluations . walzer describes experience and draws conslusions here ; he is laying a philosophical foundation and implying , if not prescribing , moral norms from which the rules have been extracted . be forewarned , he does not cut the reader any slack . this book requires some serious attention to the author 's train of thought . just war theory has two categories : the justice of going to war , and the justice of fighting once in a war . walzer 's discussion usefully and clearly separates the two and examines via historical events what we regard as right and wrong within each sphere . in doing this he has done the modern world a tremendous service . his logical breakdown speaks to thousands of years of tradition about what thinkers have considered right and wrong in war . one of the best outcomes of this landmark work is the complete debunking of the notion that \" all is fair in love and war . \" that is the path of least moral resistance ( or as clausewitz would say , \" friction \" ) , yet we all know that soldiers are honored for fighting well and loathed for behaving like armed thugs and murderers . what is amazing from the discusion is the realization that walzer knows he has to attack that age-old notion , something our collective sense of justice has historically always rejected . yet it remains a prevailing idea for many . originally coined by the romans it seems ( walzer quotes them , \" in war the laws are silent \" ) , they themselves were self-consciously contrite over the fates they inflicted on the greeks and carthginians . the book rates five stars for rigorously addressing this issue alone . some make the mistake of thinking walzer is a pacifist- -far from it . on the otherside some critics find his argument about \" supreme emergency \" a moral failure and a cop-out . the case of nazi germany is his paradigmatic case of supreme emergency , one where normal rules may be relaxed , if ever so little , because of the especially pernicious nature of state-sponsored genocide . the same relaxation of restraints would likely apply to islamic terror . in contrast walzer does not see imperial japan , for instance , as having represented a supreme emergency , and so the atomic bombings and the fire bombings of cities could not be morally justified . readers may want to compare his view to paul fussell 's perspective in the essay \" thank god for the atom bomb . \" significantly for current events , readers interested in the distinction between pre-emptive and preventive war will find a well articulated argument here . the us attack on iraq was and still is often justified as pre-emptive . that impulse on the part of the neo-conservatives who devised or whipped up the casus belli reflects , i think , a need to cloak a morally questionable war in the robes of legitimacy . there is no way that attack can be justified under the historically accepted norms of \" pre-emption . \" michael walzer 's well-thought distinction between pre-emption and prevention makes sense even in the milieu of asymmetric warfare against terror and islamic radicalism , and it clearly shows why the iraq war was a moral mistake from the start , regardless of its practical success down the road , if we are fortunate enough to see that . the moral precedent of engaging in preventive war will continue to haunt america long into the future . the fact that iraq was not even on the spectrum where the fine line between pre-emption and prevention exists is a telling aspect of the overall ongoing strategic fiasco . where one fails to recognize the moral high ground , one is doomed to moral failure . walzer was vocal about the run-up to war in 2003 , and those who read his book would do well to find his comments about the iraq invasion ; they are edifying in terms of understanding the overall argument and where we are going in this role as the world 's police force\n",

' [indeed this has always seemed to be mr. kissinger 's view also] ; and that soviet unreasonableness was a product of american hawkish unreasonableness and that balance , compromise and reasonableness were achievable with enough negotiation . my memory is of positive disdain for the emerging tax revolt in california and absolute dread at the more confrontational foreign policy approach being urged by followers of governor reagan . a major positive for me was the explanatory diagrams and the furtively taken photographs of soviet missiles ( ss-20s ? ) being deployed in russian forests . i was reminded of these diagrams in 2002 / 3 when the modern sunday times gave excellent descriptions - supported by diagrams - of saddam 's mobile chemical / biological weapons labs - which turned out not to exist . in saying all the above , i mean both to pay tribute to harold evans and to put in context the criticisms i have of this book - which contains descriptions of his triumphs as sunday times editor and his difficulties as times editor under rupert murdoch . the book has three sections - the first describes some of the episodes which made evan 's sunday times great - the investigative reports from the insight team and others , of malicious cover-ups of poor quality in the pharmaceutical industry ( thalidomide ) and the aircraft industry ( mcdonnell douglas ) ; the publication of the crossman diaries - laying bare the rivalries and mutual disdain of the members of the british labour cabinet . having established his credentials as a ` vertical ' journalist - evan 's term , which he describes as ` seeking to get to the bottom of things ' - and lauding his proprietors , the thomson 's , for allowing him to do so , the second part of the book deals with the advent of mr. murdoch as owner . the machinations of murdoch to gain control are fascinating , the thomson 's were drained both financially and personally by the losses induced by union activity , and they secretly dealt with murdoch while other offers were being pursued by the editors . murdoch eventually won ownership of both the times and sunday times , having given guarantees of editorial freedom to a board of ` national directors ' , guarantees , which if breached , were theoretically amenable to criminal legal sanction . as part of the change of ownership evans was offered the editorship of the times - one of the free worlds most revered titles . in his description of the paper , evans reveals an almost po-faced reverence for the place of the times as part of the british establishment - he sees it as the paper of record , upholding fair , non-partisan and accurate journalism which british society has come to expect . one feature of this is his constant enumeration of people 's educational background , almost every colleague is named and then his / her school and university are listed - for example joe smith , winchester , oxford , to establish both social class and academic ( perhaps intellectual ) credentials . he documents the ` four pillars ' of the times as its reporting of parliament , its legal coverage , its obituaries and its leader columns . oh dear ! stolid stuff , from the fearless , vertical , investigative editor . nonetheless this section contains fascinating accounts of evan 's new broom editorship coming to terms with the rather lazy attitude to scoops and freshness of news which , by implication , criticise his predecessor as editor ( william rees mogg ) ; and show that change was indeed necessary at the institution . looming behind this story is murdoch 's general management style - haphazard interventions , secretive finances and lack of budgeting and planning . from the text it seems to me that murdoch was overstretched with transatlantic acquisitions , rather than covertly scheming to undermine evans . the third section of the book reads a bit like macbeth - murdoch plots to renege on his guarantees and to impose his will on the editors . the text here is well paced and descriptive - the tension plays havoc with everyone , save perhaps murdoch , evan 's second-in-command betrays him , various functionaries within the paper either resign or become lackeys , the ` national directors ' turn out to be paper tigers ( this is too good a pun to delete ) , the thatcher government sides with murdoch and fails to taken any action as the guarantees are broken , piecemeal . the thrust of this section reveals evans as tragic hero , valiantly striving to uphold freedom of speech against the devious , double-dealing murdoch , whose lackeys live in fear of his disapproval . however , by the time i got to this section i had , sadly , lost a lot of respect for evan 's impartiality , his defence of press freedom seemed to me to cloak an innate inability to face change in the form of new commercial and political realities . this was reaffirmed in my mind when , on the day that evan 's agreed to reign , who should phone to commiserate but henry kissinger ! in the end i think the book is important in that it is illustrates that one important feature of change and leadership is that they are neither comfortable nor , initially at least , popular . evans , though personally engaging - and i 'm sure mercurial and demanding - came to represent a set of fading political beliefs . the change occurring at the times these events described were taking place saw the emergence of economic individualism unleashed by lowering taxation rates ; the antipathy to organised labour and active military competition with the soviet union . the fading , indeed failing , social democratic consensus was overthrown by a more individualistic and competitive set of beliefs and the process was quite ugly , given the sincerely held beliefs on both sides . i believe evans and murdoch were representative shadows of this change . the rest of the story - evans attractive forthrightness , murdoch 's furtive acquisitiveness - while the human interest focus of the story , are ultimately a side show . this book is well told , highly dramatic and engaging , however seen at a remove of twenty five years it is a lament from someone who worked hard to become part of an establishment whose day was done .\n",

      "10289: pos => neg : i was introduced to the matthew shepard story by mtv 's dramatic presentation of matthew 's last days in laramie . with that as my background , i entered the laramie project with curiosity regarding the reactions of laramie 's townspeople to this tragedy that received national attention . matthew was a human being , undeserving of the cruel torture that led to his death . shameless hatred was definitely reflected by several laramie residents , but not everyone shared that view . that fact was refreshing . the law enforcement officer who freed matthew from the fence at the scene of the crime was incredibly sympathetic . her personal views concerning his lifestyle were not revealed , but her view of this youth as an innocent victim of a horrific crime were apparent . other laramie residents were just as horrified . the so-called clergyman who brazenly expressed a heartless sentiment to one of the interviewers was expected , but equally unnerving . this film , though actors portrayed the townspeople interviewed , has the feel of a documentary . knowing that the expressions were accurate was alarming at times . but the presentation was enlightening . the film addressed the fact that hate crimes are just that - crimes . no matter what a person 's viewpoint , lifestyle or background , no one has a right to take on the position of punisher . humans are not animals . or , at least they should n't act like them . the laramie project exposes the heart of many people after the matthew shepard murder . it is worth the watch\n",

      "10298: pos => neg : i 'm a horn performance major , and i bought this box set because i needed recordings of all of beethoven 's symphonies but at a low cost . now first off , yes , they sound great . however , i 've noticed a problem in the first movement of the fifth symphony : karajan changes beethoven 's orchestration ! allow me to explain : the horn players at the time would have been using valveless horns - - instruments bound to the overtone series . on the \" natural \" or \" hand \" horn , pitches that fall on the overtone series can be played without adjustment ( like a bugle ) but any other note must be bent into tune by using the right hand to close off the bell . this technique was effective in allowing the horn to play most chromatic pitches , however , the \" stopped \" notes have an entirely different tone color ; most composers favored \" open \" pitches , especially for symphonic works . in the exposition , the second theme is announced by a call in e-flat by the horns . however , in the recap , the same call must be in the tonic ( c ) , as dictated by sonata form . the horn part is written for e-flat horns , which meant they would have been tuned so that the harmonic series emphasised e-flat major , the relative major . the e-flat call of the exposition falls entirely on partials the hornists can play with no significant adjustment - - they are all \" open \" notes . however , in the recapitulation , the c call would include two \" closed \" notes if it were played by the e-flat horn . the horns could change crooks and become c horns , in which case the call would again be all open partials , but beethoven does not do this ; i am uncertain whether he wanted the horns in e-flat for the transition , leaving them no time to change , or if it was simply not yet common practice to change crooks in the middle of a movement . for whatever reason , beethoven left the horns in e-flat and rather than writing the call in the horns again , which would include stopped pitches and have a very different sound , beethoven moved the call to the bassoons . in karajan 's recording , the second theme is announced by the horns in both the exposition and the recapitulation . granted , if beethoven had been writing for our modern valve horns , he might have written both calls in the horn section . there is no way to prove for certain that this is the case , however . it strikes me as very arrogant to \" correct \" beethoven 's instrumentation , and i feel that a respect for historical accuracy by preserving the master 's writing is a more prudent performance choice .\n",

      "10309: pos => neg : this camera is simply amazing ! i started out with a canon g2 , and then a canon g6 , and then a canon 20d , and now this canon 1d mark ii n . i debated and researched for 3 months between the 1ds mark ii , 5d , and 30d . my decision was primarily narrowed down to the 5d and this 1d mark ii n . yes , i wish this camera was a full-frame and also shared the 12.8 mp like the 5d , but you know what ? it practically killed me trying to weigh the pros and cons and finally i made my decision to go with this one and i 'm 110% glad that i did . for me , this camera is definitely the one to get because the 45 point focusing , 8.5 fps , and the 1d pro body / interface / menu / layout , etc is what really makes this camera worth it and the deciding factor . trust me , if you do n't know how seriously fast the 8.5 fps really is , you need to go out to your camera store and try it out before you decide . because of this 8.5fps alone , i 'm actually able to capture a lot of shots that i normally get lucky getting with my 20d . and with a 5d at 3fps , i just said forget it...no way . i 'm not even a professional taking pictures for a living . this is just purely a fun hobby for me and stepping up from a 20d to this camera is out of this world . with the phenomenal auto focusing , additional metering , it 's like i 'm now playing with a bentley ( with the 1d mk2 n ) coming from a mercedes c230 hatchback ( the cheapest mercedes that people buy just because it 's a mercedes name and they do n't want to spend any more money on a real mercedes ) . this camera and the photos truly almost help me take pictures like a pro . also , i do n't shoot action pictures all the time , and i do love portrait photography , and landscapes and printing and blowing up large sized pictures . but even with the 1.3 crop factor , there is still a huge improved difference going from a 1.6 crop and you wo n't have vignetting problems with some lenses that you 'll have on a 5d . with this 1d mk2 n , you can still take wonderful wedding photography , landscapes , etc. as much as i 'd like to have 12.8mp like the 5d , 8mp is really all that we need these days unless you 're going to blow up and print photos that are larger than 8x10 's or around there . unless you 're printing extremely large posters and whatnot , you can pretty much do everything with this camera that the 5d can . the resolution and mp is definitely enough . plus , it 's also invaluable to know that you have the 8.5 fps available and ready to use if you need to and you can also tone it down and use a slower fps if you need to . the extra bonuses with this camera which i look at as a secondary positive , are the weather seals , pro-build high quality construction body , easy to use and navigate menu system , you can see the iso information in the viewfinder as well as the lcd screen at all times , dual memory card capability , you can shoot on 2 memory cards at the same time as one for backup or use 2 separate cards independently , built-in battery grip ( you do n't have to shell out extra for this ) , longer battery life than the other cameras , best customization and most options that you can set to your liking , more than the 5d or the 20d or 30d . i could go on and on but definitely get this camera if you can afford it . otherwise , the 5d is also a great choice too if you need to save the money , and all you do is take landscape pictures all day long , or never will have a use for fast action or have a need to capture quick moments , and do n't want the fast and most accurate focusing system that 's great for ai servo .\n",

      "10520: pos => neg : my first favorite television series was \" twelve o'clock high \" and i had at least two models of the \" memphis belle \" when i was kid , all of which simply reflects the fact that the b-17 flying fortress is my favorite airplane . when i was a kid my family was driving through california and there was a b-17 parked out on somebody 's front lawn on a ranch and for years i tried to figure out how to go back and see it . a couple of decades later one of the few b-17s still flying came to the zenith city and i finally got to go inside one ( this big bombers are a lot smaller than i ever thought ) . for all i know that particular b-17 ended up flying in the 1990 film \" memphis belle . \" when i had occasion to drive through the city of memphis , of course i made a point of visiting mud island where the \" memphis belle \" was on display ( she was moved to the air force museum in dayton , ohio this october ) . the \" memphis belle \" ( serial no . 41-24485 ) was one of 12 , 750 b-17 flying fortresses built by the boeing aircraft company , but it was the most famous because it was the first heavy bomber to complete 25 combat missions over hitler 's europe without losing a crew member . the idea of 25 missions and going home was established by the bomber command as an incentive for air crews because morale was desperately low after the first three months of american combat flights over europe during which eighty percent of the planes were shot down . the \" belle \" flew from november 7 , 1942 to may 17 , 1943 and its final flight is the fanciful subject of this film directed by michael caton-jones ( \" scandal \" ) from the script by monte merrick ( \" staying together \" ) . that simply means that besides the fact that the \" memphis belle \" was named for a lady friend ( margaret polk ) of the pilot and that the art on the nose depicting the same ( designed by the famous artist george petty ) there is nothing here that is historically accurate when it comes to that final mission , which was over lorient , france and not bremen , germany ( the \" belle \" flew there on its 21st mission ) . the names of the crew are all changed and i think the same applies to the plane 's mascot , a scotty dog named \" stuka . \" so if you want something closer to the \" true \" story of the pilot robert morgan and the \" memphis belle \" you want to check out william wyler 's 1944 documentary \" the memphis belle : a story of a flying fortress . \" what you have here instead is a hollywood movie that celebrates the men who flew these bombers in world war ii by incorporating a wide variety of clichés from war movies involving airplanes . then there is the whole idea that americans from all walks of life who have little in common besides a desire to get home alive band together to fight the nazis . so it is we have the young and recognizable faces of matthew modine as the business like pilot , eric stoltz as the poetic radio operator , tate donovan as the co-pilot who wants to actually do something before he goes home , d.b. sweeney as the navigator who is convinced his number is up , billy zane as the bombardier who left medical school to fight , sean austin as the runt who is stuck in the ball turret , reed edward diamond as the flight engineer , courtney gains and neil giuntoli as the bickering waist gunners , and harry connick as tail gunner and sometime crooner . back at the base david strathairn plays the commanding officer nervous about his boys getting back alive and john lithgow is the public relations officer the army has sent to celebrate the final mission of the \" belle . \" of course , it is hard to create tension given that most viewers know the \" memphis belle \" is remembered for completing that final mission , so any tension that is created tends to be somewhat artificial although there are some nice moments during the bomb run ( the film might play better if it simply inspired by the \" belle \" and they changed the name of the aircraft as well ) . but even if the \" belle \" survives there are other several b-17 crews on the mission who will not . still , the idea that doing your duty could not just be dangerous but be outright suicidal is communicated , allowing modine 's character to explain the job to his nervous crew and underscore that americans do not believe in collateral damage . but what will probably stand out in this film is the grim lesson that donovan 's character learns when he tries to be a hero by doing somebody else 's job .\n",

' ' holo mai pele ' is an exciting and exotic multi-media production that i found absoultely engrossing . the director seamlessly moves the viewer back and forth between the preparation of the event in the dance studio , the on-stage performance and beautiful film footage of the enchanting hawaiian landscape . the on-stage performance is also greatly enhanced by a large screen behind the dancers showing footage of volcanic eruptions , lava flows and lush tropical rainforests . all of this is underscored by an intermitent narrative explaining the history of the hula and the mythological tale of the volcano goddess pele and her battle with her youngest sister hi'iaka . the narrative is the perfect compliment to the production and in no way detracts the viewer from the performance . this dvd serves as both a wonderful introduction to the novice in hawaiiana and a much needed and revered document to the initiated providing a performance that attests to the power and immense beauty of the hula and its embodiment of the hawaiian ' spirit of aloha .

( it 's been 2 months since i 've mailed it and not received it yet ) . 7. uses about 10mb of system background resources versus norton 's 30mb . cons against trend micro 2005 : 1. very annoying auto-virus update every day that i log on the internet . i only have a 56k connection and updating takes 5 minutes . i 'm not trying to save the internet but everyday update may be a bit too much so i would prefer to have a preference setting that i can choose myself . norton is not as annoying . 2. on a wifi network , trend micro firewall failed 5 of the gibson research shields up test . ports were open . norton internet firewall close all major holes except for the non-critical ones which was n't a big worry . i ended up disabling trend micro firewall and using the norton firewall instead as it 's a full software and much better analysis and deeper protection . 3. anti-spam and data protection were subpar as i got advertisements and pop-up from certain websites like west cost major newspaper . using norton firewall stops them dead ; never seen them again . 4. still waiting for rebate . overall , i think using trendmicro internet security 2005 for it 's fast virus check and a separate norton internet firewall is the ideal combo for me . on it 's own merit , trend micro would be perfect only if ram and other resources are low as the case with my laptop but i would n't mind using norton if i had plentiful more ram .\n",

      "10837: neg => pos : murky : in his book , 1984 , orwell described a contrived language he called \" newspeak \" , designed to render politically incorrect ideas inexpressible . but before orwell there were russell and whitehead , who contrived a symbolic logic that distorts ideas they deemed philosophically incorrect by combining logical quantification with expression of existence . as whitehead wrote in his \" foreword \" to quine 's ph.d . dissertation titled a system of logic : logic shapes metaphysical thought . thus in his \" on universals \" quine argued that in the russellian logic realism must be expressed by quantifying over predicates so they reference universals as \" entities \" . and he co-authored with goodman \" steps toward a constructive nominalism \" , a nominalist manifesto , in which all philosophers are classified as either nominalists or \" platonists \" depending on whether or not predicates are quantified so they reference entities . i believe that anyone who says that universals are \" referenced \" or who uses the phrase \" abstract entities \" fully deserves to be labeled a platonist . but loux uses the rhetoric from the russellian nominalist newspeak . in the \" search inside this book \" screens at this amazon web site the reader will find him reporting ( p . 20 ) that realists say universals are shared \" entities \" and are \" referents \" of predicates . i ask loux : what happened to signification ? the symbolic logician alonzo church recognized sense ( i.e. signification ) as well as denotation ( i.e. reference ) in the functional ( i.e. predicate ) calculus . i ask loux : what happened to supposition , which distinguishes reference from signification ? in his book titled meaning and necessity rudolf carnap explicitly affirms that intensions ( i.e. significations ) may be said to be objective without invoking any hypostatization ( i.e. reference ) , and are indifferent to either concrete or abstract objects . i ask loux : since the demise of logical positivism does the russellian predicate calculus have any applications in philosophy or anywhere else ? is loux trying to appear contemporary with the russellian rhetoric ? i see murky writing . muddled : loux is sympathetic to aristotle and unsympathetic to quine , the pragmatic realist , who rejects first philosophies with their prejudicial ontological criteria for scientific criticism , and who affirms ontological relativity in which ontological commitment is subordinated to empirical testing . ontological relativity started as an analogy : quine relativized ontology as einstein relativized time . einstein posited relativistic time as real time instead of newton 's absolute time , and he rejected lorentz 's making relativistic time apparent time . likewise heisenberg invoked this einstein precedent for his own realistic copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory 's positing of duality and indeterminacy . today physicists describe reality in terms of superposition , nonlocality and calabi-yau spaces in eleven dimensions . quine generalized beyond physics to our global web of beliefs . realism is a natural , primordial , irrepressible prejudice motivated by disappointments in our beliefs including falsifications of our scientific theories . on the other hand ontology is anything but natural or primordial . it is an elaborately complex linguistic artifact that evolves and that has a cultural history . it is reality as cognitively captured by the artifactual semantics of language expressing our accepted general beliefs including our tested and currently nonfalsified scientific theories . but in notre dame journal of formal logic and in this book loux rejects ontological relativity , and he calls philosophies using ontological relativity \" anti-realism \" . in fact ontological relativity and relativized semantics do not oppose realism , but rather they enable it in this age of scientific change . i do not find this book contemporary . loux 's \" realism - anti-realism \" locution is a false dichotomy . i see muddled thinking . marginalized : while a student i found notre dame 's philosophy faculty unsympathetic to contemporary pragmatism and its scientific realism . when i left their graduate school of philosophy i took with me the opinion that their academic culture is a marginalized backwater preferring to protect the past rather than forge the future with new thinking . i see in this book a textbook in notre dame metaphysics for notre dame philosophy students . readers who are cognizant of the influence of modern science on philosophy - notably how quantum theory occasioned the emergence and ascendancy of contemporary pragmatism - are likely to be more critical of this book than other reviewers at this amazon site . thomas j . hicke\n",

      "10910: neg => pos : i knew that this concert dvd was an acoustic show so i was n't surprised that the tempo was slow at the beginning . but to start the show with gilmour tuning his guitar was a bit much . once he did start playing , gilmour was having such a hard time finding his rhythm that i found myself praying for the drums to kick in . by the time things settle down , the really glaring problem with this dvd comes to the surface . the mix is horrible . the crowd noise drowns out gilmour at times when they cheer a song they recognize , he is almost inaudible when talking between songs and at many points the backup singers completely cancel him out . i found myself constantly adjusting the volume which really takes away from the \" concert experience \" . there are high points in the show , but the low points are rock bottom . comfortably numb is a song that millions of people know by heart . two versions are provided on this dvd - from the concert and in the bonus section . neither of the guest singers ( robert hewitt and sir bob geldoff ) know the words , have to read from sheet music and based on their phrasing have never heard the song before . gilmour would have been better off asking for a volunteer from the audience . the very best thing on this dvd is , oddly enough , in the bonus section . screamin ' jay hawkins ' i put a spell on you , a blues standard performed with mica paris and jools holland , almost makes the dvd worth buying . almost . watch jonathan demme 's beautiful treatment of neil young : heart of gold if you really want to see a great acoustic show . that is the gold standard .\n",

      "10912: pos => neg : this software is wonderful ! i have been trying to find a good program to scrapbook digitally for many years . i 've tried broderbund ( sp ? ) whose interface was too clumsy , nova which was rather difficult at times ( many things you ca n't do ) and now this . when i first took this out of the package and installed it i thought i had made the wrong decision with this software since there were very , very few backgrounds , templates or embellishements even when i opened the xtras cds that came with this . i truly did not feel the xtras cds were worth purchasing since there are very few things on them . but then i found the tutorials that are included on the cd and watched the one about making collages . i did n't get halfway through the video - i had figured out how to do it . i have now created some of the best scrapbook pages i 've ever made . within hours i had a beautiful collage / letter to send with my holiday cards . my husband 's first impression was a heartfelt \" it 's lovely \" . what has so throughly convinced me of the abilities of this software is that i can take any image and make it a background , i can create and manipulate text almost any way i want , i 've been able to create my own embellishments as well as using downloaded embellishments from websites that sell it ( .png format ) . i feel like i have no limitations on what i can do now . i imagine this software is not as sophistacated as adobe illustrator , but then it probably is n't as complicated to use ( from what i remember that program has a rather steep learning curve ) . you can also use the eyedropper tool to \" pick up \" any color from any picture , background , or element ( read \" anything \" ) in the program . i was able to take the background colors and make embellishments that matched ! i can take a color from one of my pictues and make a background that matches . you can also remove backgrounds from photos - it takes a bit of time to do , but the area around the image will be transparent - this functionality has many uses . you can also save your files in many different formats including .jpg for file sharing , etc. there are so many more features i could n't possibly list them here , nor would you want me too ( too much time ) . if you only use premade templates and do n't feel ready to venture out on your own yet this software may not be for you unless you find a website that sells templates for this software . you could start with something like nova scrapbook factory deluxe 3.0 , which i liked , and when you start becoming really frustrated by its limiations it may be time to move up to this program . you may also want to read a book about digital scrapbooking to give you ideas and alert you to possibilities . the great thing about this program is that it is n't just for scrapbooking . you can do all your photo manipulation in it . i have always liked paint shop pro so much that i have n't been able to afford to upgrade my copy since version 6 , but i kept using that version . i 'm so glad i got version 10 as it is very user friendly too . but please know that version 10 ( which comes with this package ) is not the most recent version . version 11 is out now . if you do n't want / need the xtras cds that come with this package you may want to just buy the most recent version and buy some embellishements from a website that makes .png files ( portable network graphics format ) or make your own . i hope you have as much fun with this software as i am having . i highly recommend the training videos on the cd - they really help\n",

      "10914: pos => neg : i must say my first reaction was to be surprised at how much better hawking is at explaining modern physics than my college instructors were . heisenberg 's uncertainty principle was just an equation i learned . hawking made it seem like common sense . hawking tries a little too hard to be witty at times ( and punctuates all of his jokes with exclamation points ! just in case you missed them ! ) , but all-in-all , this was a quite readable account of what 's presently known about cosmology . i use the term \" presently \" guardedly , as just recently there was some big finding about dark matter ( it exists ! ) , but from now on , when there are new findings in physics , i want hawking to explain them to me , because i feel like then i might understand them . that 's why you should read this book . the reason you should not read this book is because you have no interest in wrestling with abstractions with which you will never interact in daily life , and would rather read about global warming or darfur or something a bit more topical and practical . this was still a hard read , and i feel like i grasped maybe 80% of it . for you to decide , but for a former engineering student , this was something i wish i had read when i was taking physics\n",

      "10921: pos => neg : i have used corel draw since it was draw 5 or 6 , i ca n't exactly recall for certain so i guess some would consider me a software guru . i have also used other top level design tools and can tell you the fact is the corel draw suite x3 is a robust design suite that has a very palatable learning curve . the scope of what you can do with the software is amazing so certainly there is a new set of words to add to one 's vocabulary however with terms like pick tool , rectangle tool , ellipse tool , and the like , i believe that it is pretty logical to get an idea of what the tools do just by allowing the mouse pointer to rest over the tool for about three seconds so the application can display the tool name and even the shortcut key to select the tool . the icons also give a pretty clear visual representation of what the tool will do e.g. a capital a is the text tool and guess what you do with it ... it allows you to add paragraph text , and artistic text . after you learn a bit about the text tool you also see that it allows you to place text in your document on a path . the text on a path is just that.. . text on any path in your document . this can be a freehand line , an ellipse , a circle , or any other shape you care to make . how many of you have ever wanted to put your text in an arch ? in corel draw you simply make an ellipse with the ellipse tool , choose the text tool from the tool box , move the mouse pointer over to the ellipse and the mouse cursor changes to the text on a path icon and you click the left mouse button . now you type whatever you want around the shape that you have created . if the text is not the size , color , font , or position you want you can change it , color it , or move it simply by selecting the pick tool . i have developed a program to teach technology skills to middle & high school students with various disabilities in 46 sites throughout oklahoma and the corel draw suite is the first software application the students use . do the students know how to do everything with the software after the first week , or fourth , or tenth ? no , but if it took a week to learn it would not be a design tool in would be something like print shop pro where almost everything is done for you and you just type in the text . there is nothing wrong with psp but if you want to truly be creative , if you want to have the ability to design anything that you can see in your minds eye , then the corel draw suite is the tool you want . my program has a website that shows some of the work the students in the program have created . just do a search for tech-now oklahoma high school high tech and you should be able to find the site . the section on weekly curriculum is a pretty good place to start but i encourage you to look around . almost everything you will see on the site was created by the students using the corel draw suite . corel draw is a program that can be used in a matter of minutes but is as deep as you can possibly want to go .\n",

      "11155: pos => neg : by winning their third title in four years the same year that the baseball team that defines the hopes and dreams of generations of new englanders wins its first world series in 86 years . it 's true , the patriots somehow pieced together a team that , despite a string of injuries that seemed to defy all rationality and managed to finish a second consecutive campaign as super bowl champions with a 17-2 record ( which just as easily could have / should have been 18-1 ) ...but the 2004 boston red sox completely sucked the oxygen out of the american sports atmosphere and somehow the 2004 patriots season just does n't seem to measure up to the previous title years of 2001 and 2003. part of the reason is that the previous years seemed to have their own personalities ( 2001 having 9 / 11 , the coming-of-age of tom brady , the snow bowl , and the unbelievable finish of what was probably the most exciting super bowl ever . 2003 had the release of lawyer milloy , the early stumbles to buffalo and washington , the birth of the winning streak , winter weather in foxboro , and yet another thrilling super bowl finish ) ; 2004 just seemed like an anticlimax by comparison , like you were watching a scripted performance that was always going to end with the \" w \" on the patriots ' side of the field . this is not to say that there were not intriguing challenges that made for good storytelling...the injuries ( leading to the incredible \" throwback \" two-way play of veteran wide receiver / rookie cornerback troy brown ) , the continued winning streak , the rebirth of offseason acquisition corey dillon , the continuing mastery of the indianapolis colts , and the return to pittsburgh ( where the record 21-game winning streak came to an emphatic end on halloween ( just days after the red sox won the world series , karmically enough ) , where university of michigan graduate tom brady resurrected himself from a triple-digit fever the night before to thoroughly dismantle the best regarded defense in the nfl to send the patriots back to the super bowl , this time in the unfairly maligned city of jacksonville , fl . no nail-biting endings this time , though...despite the best efforts of terrell owens to come back from a leg and ankle injury that would have ended the season of anyone else ( with the possible exception of curt schilling , of course ) , the eagles all-pro was clearly the second-best receiver on the field as deion branch won the super bowl mvp for a record day ( safetyman and render of mayhem extraordinaire rodney harrison would have been my pick , actually ) and the patriots , though trailing early , never really seemed in doubt of winning a game they led by 10 points late before prevailing by the final score of 24-21 which in truth flattered the eagles more than they deserved . far be it that a season ending with a record of 17-2 and another super bowl ring should be considered hum-drum , but there was something missing from the 2004 campaign that , impressive as it was , just does n't translate to the memorable re-telling that the pats ' previous title years do . this is a great dvd for pats fans , indispensible even , but for the casual fan who appreciates the drama that a good nfl season can bring , i would recommend either of the previous patriots highlights dvd 's over this one\n",

      "11174: pos => neg : this just arrived thursday so these comments come with minimal time on camera so far . i am also absolutely an amateur user of camcorders so i wo n't be able to comment on the quality of the manual controls , etc. i agree closely with the other two reviews so i wo n't repeat their details . i 'll try to hit a few other topics and also compare the hc7 to the sony hc90 , an earlier model that took 16:9 standard definition video with 3 mp stills . i have taken about one hour of hd video so far , and have viewed it through an hdmi cable on a sony 46 \" xbr lcd tv ( 1080p ) . i captured a few indoor scenes , a few neighborhood outdoor scenes , and some footage at harper 's ferry in west virginia - river , mountain , and two trains passing by at close range while i was at the railroad station there . i can say comfortably that you wo n't confuse the video from this camcorder with standard definition camcorder video - when they say high definition , they are n't kidding . if your tv can show the video off to advantage and you 've grown fond of hd , i think you 'd be pleased with this camcorder . in my case , the overwhelming reason i upgraded camcorders was to get the hd video , so this has made it worth the steep expense . my second requirement is to have a camcorder that took decent stills so i only have to carry one piece of equipment around . i already had this in the sony hc90 at 3mp , so going up to 6mp was desirable but not enough to make me buy something this expensive in itself . my only output criticisms so far are that the west virginia footage looks a little brighter and the water a little greener than i remember . i did n't play with any settings so take that with a grain of salt . these camcorders have a lot of manual adjustments you can make which i have not explored . one or more of them undoubtedly would have given me improved footage , and i 'm not unhappy with what i think i noticed in the slightest . the stills look very good to me so far , but i 've only taken about 20 and viewed them on the tv . i normally view stills on a pc . i do n't have a telephoto lens yet so i ca n't report on the quality of the stabilization . i used a tripod today and that was readily apparent in the stability of the video . i was very pleased , by the way , with how well the camera did with the moving trains . very crisp where i expected a fair bit of motion blur . lcd size and controls have been mentioned in first looks . i 'm perfectly happy with a 2.7 \" lcd instead of the larger one in the ux7. so this was n't a negative for me personally . the controls ( menus ) are highly similar to those of the sony hc90 i already have . if you have n't seen them before , there 's a learning curve . if you have the hc90 or another camcorder with those menus , you 'll be right at home with the hc7. one note : you can configure p[ersonal]-menus to include the things you use the most in your own order , in addition to the camcorder 's menus . one thing i forgot is that each mode ( video , camera , play / edit ) has its own configurable personal menu . so i was looking for things to add to the play / edit personal menu that i was sure should be configurable , but could n't find them . that was because they belonged only to the filming side , not to the playback side . so you 've got three personal menus you can create , not one . battery : check the sizes on the batteries . the hc90 batteries were very thin . i think three of the batteries for the hc7 fit entirely within its case . the fourth and largest battery looked to be much bigger in one dimension such that i thought it would extend past the end of the camera 1 / 2 \" or so . the other three will fit flush into the back of the camera , though they 're not behind a door or anything . battery life : my impression so far is that the battery life statements are accurate , but the batteries drain faster than that of the hc90. this is almost certainly a function of increased power load instead of the older batteries being better than the newer ones . the ccds and the stills and everything are all \" more \" than in the hc90. so i think i 'm fine with the battery life , but you 'll need to watch it and definitely have more than one battery . size compared to the hc90 : this struck me as being about 10-15% bigger overall than the hc90. it 's maybe 1 / 2 \" longer front to back , and wider as well . i think the hc7 is one notch up in size from the average camcorder i see in best buy . but it 's noticeably smaller than last year 's sr1 sony hard disk camcorder , say . i do n't see dropping this one in a coat pocket like i did with the hc90 , but it 's pretty light and still fits in the case i used for the hc90 if i do n't load other stuff in there . fit in the hand : i found a best buy with an hc5 and ux5 on hand and played with both at the same time . these have the same footprint as the hc7 and ux7 as far as i can tell . the hc5 's tape case is maybe 3 / 8 \" wider than the ux5 's dvd case . the ux5 's dvd case is maybe 1 / 4 \" higher . so i found that my right-hand fingers curled nicely around the smaller but taller ux5 and it felt slightly more comfortable . however , i found that the hc5 's extra width made me curl my palm slightly such that the base of the camcorder fit solidly on top of the ball of my thumb . as i played with this in the store , i realized it seemed like the hc5 actually was easier to hold stable because of this . absolutely try these two out on your own instead of assuming this will be true for you . just wanted to say that the two cases do differ a bit and will probably feel different to you at some level . tape vs dvd ( really hdv vs avchd ) : i spent a lot of time wondering if the noise reported in last year 's avchd ux camcorders would still be present , and if i would care in any case . the detailed reviews still are n't out , so i do n't know whether there will be a noise problem there . but i can say i noticed nothing in the footage so far that i 'd call noise , so my decision to go with the tape and hdv format looks very good to me right now . i have never had the problems people report with mini-dv tapes , so that whole transport discussion ( tape vs dvd ) did n't weigh on me much . the noise discussion did have an effect on my decision , though . getting the video to your tv : \" how much money do we have ? \" , apparently . i played the tape back to the tv directly , but that 's not a long-term solution . i have heard that you can capture the hdv video and then will be able to transform it on a pc to formats suitable for blu-ray or hdv burners , if you have the money . then you need a blu-ray or hdv player attached to your tv . for now , it sounds like many people are archiving the hdv video to dvds as data files . then they burn playable dvds where the hd is down-converted to standard definition video . so they get to see decent versions of the video now and can produce hd versions for playback in the future as technology changes and prices drop . one other hc7 reviewer also implied that hd files captured by ulead software could be moved to a ps3 hard drive and played back to an hd tv from there . so far , the easy and cheap path we have for sd video to dvds to tvs is not quite there for hd based on what i 've read . the one extra feature i wish the camcorder had was a built-in 20x optical zoom . i 'm sure this would affect both the cost and the size of the barrel negatively , so i \" understand \" . but that would be #1 on my wish list . overall , i am amazed at what camcorder manufacturers can pack into these shells now . i know we 're talking computers that are way more powerful at image processing than anything that existed ten years ago . but it is still almost like magic to drag a camcorder of this size around , take some video , and then have play it back on a high-quality hd tv looking to me like it was taken with broadcast-level equipment . i know better intellectually , but it 's really great to have a camcorder like this that marries up with the new tvs so beautifully .\n",

      "11302: neg => pos : alright , for those of you who say rand is criticizing works for false ideals , or lacking in substance , i say this : who is rand to say what the absolute greatest ideals are ? who is rand to say what substance is ? you 've got to look at her bias , first . realize that rand never takes into account anything not related to personal freedom . as if outside factors never matter ; and maybe they do n't , for her . maybe her life in an oppressive russia did nothing to form who she is today . but i doubt it . though i believe personal choice plays a huge factor in determining who we are and how we live , outside influences do affect a person . but she doesn't . thus she condemns all works that are not driven solely by the individual as crap . all books that are not driven solely by the individual 's sense of reason : do n't read , cause it will lessen your iq . any work that portrays or is driven by an emotion she does n't find worthwhile or cannot understand , she condemns . rand , at least as portrayed in what i 've read of her work , is unfeeling toward anything but what she wants . and this is carried over into this book in what she criticizes . they cannot hold a little or a fairly large amount of quality , they are either good or worthless . the pieces of art she says are empty are empty , absolutely . they do n't fit into her paradigm thus have nothing to offer . nothing to offer her , that is . how is a completely selfish person supposed to write a critique of history 's best books , telling other people ( with different wants and ideas and all the other funtions of an individual ) what they should read ? truthfully any criticism in this form , like a list i saw detailing the 100 best literary works in the world , is elitist crap trying to close people 's minds toward books that a certain group deems lesser than others . they have their bias like anyone else . i say read in variety . observe art outside of rand 's choice of art . take in all you can , with an open mind , then start pondering whether you agree or not . if you then agree because you agree , then i say great . its the basic individualistic response that rand seems to forget to address . she says question society , but by my line of inquiry . she says be an individual , but only i know the basis of who you want to be\n",

      "11312: neg => pos : on an episode of seinfield that is probably overexposed enough as it is , the always wily and oh so goofy character of kramer is playing a game of risk and exclaims that the \" ukraine is weeeeak \" . this causes him to get a thorough scolding and a little bit of trouble . i think the same basic sentiments work with this new order release . it probably was n't worth the ungodly long eight year wait although it produced the excellent \" rock the shack \" and of course \" crystal \" , which i 'll get back to later . unlike kramer i feel i can make this statement safely as i 'm not dealing with a burly , alcohol swigging ukranian , but new order fans , which are n't the most intimidating bunch out there . keyboardist gillian gilbert is not here as she felt taking care of her kids is more important , which it is , maybe . this album features the guitar of billy corgan , the frontman of the seminal 90 's group soundgarden . too bad they could n't get billy to collaborate five years earlier because at this point he was already full blown crazy , and was n't writing very good material or really using his guitar , at all . new order also made the mistake of having corgan to backing vocals . now a synth is high pitched and shrill enough , but to top that off with a billy corgan squealing like a pig cherry is probably not the best choice . so...someone like you is more or less unlistenable . it has some pretty terrible lyrics about how bernard does n't want to wash his car . now i can relate , i would n't want to wash my car in britain since it rains all the time and would probably be an altogether futile affair , but this topic does n't result in the most captivating and well-written material . new order occasionnally want to rawk out with guitars on this album , something they do n't do very often , just like van morrison . now i 'm not sure if i 've heard a van morrison song but i 've always figured it was a give that they rawk out with guitars . case in point of this ` not so good of an idea rawking ' is rock the shack . rock the shack kind of sounds like new order 's take on someone commissioned to write an epic gilligan 's island rock song , pretty amazing huh ? ' 60 miles an hour ' , ` primitive notion ' , and ` close range ' all suffer from being a little too vanilla and a little too bland . new order have patches here where they sound like they might be suffering from the same middle-aged blandness that has crippled other 80 's artist like depeche mode , the cure , and tears for fears ( who 've actually always blown ) . however , they do succeed fully well on two songs here . there is ` crystal ' , which is truly an excellent rock song and show new order can succeed with a harder guitar edge and is probably one of the two or three best songs of new order 's career from the 90 's and beyond . how this did n't get more airplay than it did is a mystery to me , because it has the alternative rock of today written all over it . the other is run wild which is really a great little slow song , in the vein of ` as it is when it was . probably new order 's only full-fledged ballad it serves as a fitting acoustic , moving ending to an otherwise disappointing album . get ready is good beginning and end , just not end between . kind of like that movie twin peaks : fire walk with me\n",

      "11396: neg => pos : what is remarkable about this onetime best-selling book - - which could well be described as a coming-of-age-without-coming-of-age novel - - is not that fitzgerald produced it when he was all of 24. nope , the amazing thing here is that the same writer produced \" the great gatsby \" a mere five years later . \" this side of paradise \" is a mess : it is as uneven , affected , feebly pretentious and relentlessly immature as its hero , the tiresomely self-conscious young minnesotan-gone-to-princeton amory blaine . ( one suspects , in fact , that had fitzgerald abandoned his muddled third-person narrative altogether and rendered the work instead as amory 's diary the result would have been considerably more readable - - or the book 's structural and methodological flaws considerably more forgivable , at least . ) that the novel was a roaring success upon publication in 1920 - - it was to prove the most popular book , in terms of sales , ever produced by its author - - presumably speaks to the public 's recognition of something new and revealing in it . okay , amory blaine may well have been the original jazz age prototype ; and the drinking and shameless smooching ( etc. ) that he and his prep school and princeton friends indulge in at various points in the novel were probably , one can accept , a revelation to see in print ( and likely a titillating one ) for an american audience raised on mcguffy 's readers - - and ready for some sort of great departure after the great war . welp , here it comes : \" on the triangle trip amory had come into constant contact with that great current american phenomenon , the ` petting party . ' none of the victorian mothers-and most of the mothers were victorian-had any idea how casually their daughters were accustomed to be kissed . \" to the reader at a remove of some 80-plus years this is , of course , very small beer . what was alarming frankness in 1920 tends to read now , in the best cases of the paradise narrative , as unalarming quaintness . while this is not exactly fitzgerald 's \" fault \" , so to speak , it is also true that the use of \" shocking revelations \" of this type - - scandals specific to a place and time - - represents a risk a writer takes : the march of history may or may not reveal something lasting and / or universal in such episodes . in any event , the price the reader pays here , in slogging through the meandering narrative which surrounds amory 's adventures in quaintness during the nascent roaring twenties , is very , very high for payoffs of such modest proportions . i mean , come on : \" for years afterward when amory thought of eleanor he seemed still to hear the wind sobbing around him and sending little chills into the places beside his heart . the night when they rode up the slope and watched the cold moon float through the clouds , he lost a further part of him that nothing could restore ; and when he lost it he also lost the power of regretting it . eleanor was , say , the last time evil crept close to amory under the mask of beauty , the last weird mystery that held him with wild fascination and pounded his soul to flakes . \" yikes . i do n't care what new generation you 're talking about , can a flake-pounded soul really represent much of an innovation to anybody ? ( can it represent anything to anybody ? ) there are things to like , even admire , here and there in paradise . fitzgerald gets off a few of the wonderfully epigrammatic lines that were to become a trademark ( e.g. , \" they slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never recovered . \" \" sometimes i wish i 'd been an englishman ; american life is so damned dumb and stupid and healthy . \" \" it 's better to leave the blustering and tremulo-heroism to the middle classes ; they do it so much better . \" ) and the political incorrectness of some of the narrator 's observations is , in its now-curious way , refreshingly , bracingly funny : \" slowly and inevitably , yet with a sudden surge at the last , while amory talked and dreamed [which is about all amory ever does-mht] , war rolled swiftly up the beach and washed the sands where princeton played . every night the gymnasium echoed as platoon after platoon swept over the floor and shuffled out the basketball markings . when amory went to washington the next weekend , he caught some of the spirit of crisis which changed to repulsion in the pullman car coming back , for the berths across from him were occupied by stinking aliens-greeks , he guessed , or russians . \" nothing like a little wretched refuse to remind you there 's a war on , i always say . anyway , most of the novel consists of young amory 's elaborate ponderings - - romantic , philosophical and egotistical - - which are as forgivable as they are forgettable . i 've forgotten them already . at some level , in any case , fitzgerald himself had to recognize the ridiculousness of this pompous character - - who was , of course , a not-very-disguised version of himself . for how else , if not as commendably self-deprecating irony , are we to take this observation ? \" amory was in full stride , confident , nervous , and jubilant . scurrying back to minneapolis to see a girl he had known as a child seemed the interesting and romantic thing to do , so without compunction he wired his mother not to expect him , and sat in the train and thought about himself for thirty-six hours . \" in the end , in any event , one comes back to the initial fitzgerald vs. fitzgerald comparison with something like gaping wonder . in paradise almost nothing works : form , content , narrative stance , dialogue , character development , pacing - - you name it , it 's a problem . yet in gatsby , five years later , everything works - - everything . if there is to be a great american novel , it will have to supplant gatsby for the honor . while it is hard to see how fitzgerald got from point a to point b , the fact is that he did - - and without point a the journey could not have begun . so while \" this side of paradise \" hardly deserves a place in the national literary canon , it surely deserves our respect , and indeed our gratitude , for what it led to .\n",

      "11551: neg => pos : several years ago i used delorme 's street atlas with a usb gps receiver . the software worked but the interface was lousy . this year i tried microsoft 's streets and trips 2007 and was surprised to find that it has an interface that is smoother in some ways than the delorme software , but still surprisingly clumsy . and the help is possibly the worst i have seen in a microsoft product ( that 's saying a lot ) . here are some of the problems : 1. street & trips is expecting a gps receiver that uses a **com port**. are you kidding me ? in 2007 ? ? ? the delorme earthmate 20 ( usb ) will work if you use the delorme com port emulation software , but why is this necessary ? ? ? ( and it was not trivial to get it to work . ) 2. the handling of pushpins ( identifying spots on the map ) , favorite places , and the like , is extremely clumsy . ( although , contrary to another review , you do n't to re-enter the information each time . you just save the file and reload it . ) 3. directions are sometimes not so great . why would you instruct someone to \" turn left \" if you do n't know which direction they 're pointing ( e.g. , when you 're stationary in a parking lot ) ? much better in such cases to say \" head ne \" or some such . freeway exits ( at least in so . california ) were often not handled well . ( one freeway entrance was identified as a \" local road \" , which at the time proved quite confusing . ) 4. why does n't the software automatically recalculate directions to put you \" on-route \" once you 're off-route ? you can push f3 , but why is this necessary ? 5. i never got the voice providing driving guidance to work . the online help was useless . i 'm sure someone can jump in and tell me how to do it , but it should be trivial . 6. in general , the software has the feel of a bunch of modules written independently and thrown together . i 'm not a reflexive anti-microsoft bigot ( i bought this software after all ) , but i find that much ms software is bad precisely because it feels like it 's cobbled together without much attention given to integration . it 's shiny on the surface but the shine vanishes once you really start to use it . given this experience , i will probably give the delorme software another try next time around .\n",

      "11570: neg => pos : the quiet earth is overrated for a variety of reasons that will be discussed below . this movie is not the epic , thought-provoking , intelligent sci fi i was led to believe it was . it 's actually very overrated , and fans of intelligent sci fi such as 2001 or primer will likely be very disappointed . the first 30 minutes or so are jaw-dropping . i was really getting geared up for what i was sure was going to become one of my all-time favorites . the scenes of bruno standing above the wrecked passenger jet , driving around a mall , the sun rising to the haunting score- -all unforgettable . the scenes where bruno starts to lose it , running around in a slip brandishing a shotgun , setting up cardboard figures of celebrities and pretending he 's their ruler , giving them speeches ( that 's why i deserve to be president...of the quiet earth...i 've been condemned to live ) are all great . after this point the movie starts to disintegrate , and quickly . the female character is highly irritating , so much so that i think i would have ditched her and looked for other survivors . api is also highly irritating , and when the film veers away from its central mystery and starts devolving into yet another film about a petty love triangle- -my thumbs were pointing down , way down . something needs to be said about the ending of this film . so many people have said that it 's \" deep . \" how is it \" deep ? \" how is it deep when it 's just a gimmicky way to quickly wrap a rather dodgy film that really does n't have anything to say ? let 's examine this . many people argue the following ( and if they were correct the film would 've been much better than it was ) : the main character is a scientist who convinces himself that project flashlight resulted in \" the effect \" ( even though others here insist on calling it \" the event \" ) which made everyone else disappear . the main characters come to believe that \" the effect \" did n't snatch them up too because they were died right when it happened . but what if there is n't any \" effect \" at all ? what if these are just three people who died and then went to another earth where there are n't any people ? the scientist then convinces himself that \" the effect \" is going to happen again , and , understandably fed up with the fact that the only other two people on earth are a bonkers , daffy , annoying woman and a nutty , homicidal maniac , decides to basically kill himself while blowing up the satellite for project flashlight . he dies again and ends up on another world , one which this time does n't even resemble earth . the end . it would have been very clever if this was what was going on , if there really was n't an \" effect \" at all and if the three protagonists had just happened to go to the same place when they died . unfortunately , all the critics saying \" they went to another earth where everyone else was gone \" are forgetting something : the dead bodies ! i know there are n't a lot , but remember , there 's the radiation burn guy in the science station , and there 's the dead guy on the hood of his car , and the dead woman holding a cb radio , etc. if they went to another earth where life was absent , why are there dead people ? the real answer is that this movie was not very well thought out , that it does n't make sense , and that the ending is just a cheap and easy way to try and appear impressive . according to the people who worked on the film , \" the effect \" obviously did occur , and what happens at the end is that when the scientist tries to kill himself a second time he dies , again , at the exact moment that \" the effect \" occurs a second time . so at the end , \" the effect \" does occur a second time , which means the girl and api are history , and the scientist , as he again dies when \" the effect \" occurs , moves on one more time . another point that is made in the dvd commentary is that the film was made by a catholic , so the obvious purgatory then heaven tripe comes to mind . also highly irritating is that for a scientist , the main character is not very smart . he laments that he 's the last person on earth and then he runs into a nutty woman . they find a nutty guy named api and then the three of them conclude they 're the last three people on earth ! what ? ! are they totally daft ? a scientist would quickly reason that if there were three people within such a small region of the same city then there are probably other people in the city , more people than that throughout the rest of new zealand , and even more people in bigger places such as america , europe , and asia . that his first conclusion is always that \" they 're the only ones \" only demonstrates his stupidity . they come to believe that they all died at the same time , right when \" the effect \" occurred , and that that 's why they remained on earth . well , if three people died at the exact same time in the same city in tiny new zealand , then many , many other people must 've died at that time throughout the rest of the massive world .\n",

      "11602: pos => neg : having an m.a. in english literature as well as a b.a. in literature and history , anytime a movie is both historical and literary . . . well , i get a bit excited to say the least . i do n't wish to give the impression that this movie is based on absolute and authentic history because it 's not , but the writers / directors / producers set it against a \" historical \" backdrop nonetheless . on that note , this is yet another stellar title from noneother than ridley scott . with that being said , i enjoyed \" tristan and isolde \" almost as much as \" gladiator \" and a bit more than \" kingdom of heaven \" ( all of these , by the way , are ridley scott films ) . notice the historical adaptations here ? while it may be true that the story of tristan and isolde was inspirational to shakespeare 's \" romeo and juliet \" as well as possibly fueling much of the intrigue of the arthurian legend , this movie is not exclusively for the high-browed college types . no sir , good ol ' red-blooded men and women will certainly be drawn into both the action as well as the romance in this movie . this is by no means a \" chick flick \" since there is present a large degree of bloodshed and overall suspense . on the other hand , it 's not the typical \" hack and slash \" macho film because at its core is a very dynamic love story . in short , it should please both sexes simultaneously . aside from james franco ( tristan ) , i was rather unfamiliar with most of the cast . sophia myles ( isolde ) is , for the most part , a newcomer to american audiences despite a rather large resume in mostly british films . i suspect this film will provide her the recognition she certainly deserves on this side of the atlantic . while many of the other characters were convincing in their roles , no other character was more believable in his villainy than that of the arrogant irish king ( who just so happens to be isolde 's father ) . in short , this is one of the best movies i 've seen in awhile . on some levels it reminds me of \" king arthur . \" just as \" king arthur \" attempted to provide a plausible history of the legendary arthur , guinevere , and lancelot , so too does ridley scott by placing the action a few years after the establishment of the angle and saxon kingdoms in england . if you 'll recall in \" king arthur , \" arthur helps hold back the onslaught of the invading saxons just as the roman legions were exiting britannia . historians will point out that there is no evidence of saxons in england until several decades after the roman withdrawal , but oh well . . . it made for a good story . here , we witness the celtic britons as they are exploited by the irish across sea . what ? ? ? ? the irish doing the exploiting and not the other way around ? well , \" tristan and isolde \" holds true to history in this aspect ; namely , that the celtic britons of england were indeed pushed to the easternmost shores of the island after the coming of the anglo-saxons . this would , of course , have placed them in what is now wales and cornwall . and this is exactly where the movie is set . let 's not forget the story of saint patrick . remember , he was actually a romanized briton who was captured and served as a slave in ireland before escaping and ultimately returning to ireland to convert the populace to christianity . it 's interesting to note that in the movie christianity is a fairly new-fangled religion in ireland , so no doubt ridley scott intended this to remind us of the time period at hand . i particulary liked \" king arthur \" and \" kingdom of heaven \" despite the lukewarm reception they received from the critics . critically speaking , \" tristan and isolde \" has been a bit of a mixed bag as well- --but who really bases their decision to watch a movie on the arrogant views of movie critics ? rent it first if you must , but i suspect this one will be a \" keeper \" in your dvd library !\n",

      "11680: neg => pos : i bought this camera in the beginning of january . i was looking for a compact camera ( not necessarily pocket size , though ) that was capable of taking great pictures and that was also capable of taking movies in a decent quality . based on test reports at dpreview and other customer reports i decided for the fuji f31fd . i was intrigued by the new sensor that fuji is using and that seems to be very light sensitive , which is true . after receiving the camera i took a lot of test pictures under various conditions , with and without flash , bright light , low light , different iso settings , different exposure times , etc. i compared the pictures with my 4-year old sony dsc-v1 and the results were amazing . the picture quality of the fuji was very poor . colors were ' smeared ' but the main problem was noise . even under bright light conditions and iso 100 settings the white had considerable noise , same with other colors ( rgb noise ) . i did n't check grey / black noise ( as they do in the test reports ) but the noise in white and colors was just too annoying . what a disappointment . the lens seemed to be pretty poor as well , at least there was no comparison to the sony dsc-v1 with a carl zeiss lens . after one week we returned the camera and i bought the sony h5. this is really a great camera , i must admit . the picture quality is even better than with the v1 and i thought that the v1 was already pretty good . i can only recommend sony 's h5 , even though it has a different form factor and may therefore not really compare to the much smaller f31fd . what i liked about the f31fd was its size , its responsiveness and the monitor and menu . however , if the picture quality is so poor it also does n't really help\n",

      "11718: neg => pos : i was intrigued by \" satan 's little helper \" due to several things namely its halloween theme , which i 'm a big sucker for , and the heralded return of jeff lieberman to the horror scene . lieberman made 4 minor cult horror films in the 70 's and 80 's , the last one being 1987 's \" remote control \" . you would think that lieberman , with all this time off from filmmaking would have spent his share of time carefully observing horror films in order to craft a good one when he would choose to return . well , it almost feels like lieberman is stuck in some kind of time warp , as this movie looks like it came straight from the 80 's due to how cheesy , trashy , cheap and godawful it is . many , myself included , look upon the 80 's slasher craze with fond nostalgia but this is one film that reminds us how truly bad some of those films could be . the \" plot \" revolves around a 10-year old boy who is a huge fan of the video game \" satan 's little helper \" . it 's now halloween season and his mom buys him a devil costume , which he wears proudly . one afternoon , he spots a tall man wearing an equally devilish costume dragging bodies around to serve as halloween decoration stiffs for the front of his house . he becomes enamored with the tall & mute masked man and asks him if he can be his helper . the two then go on a rampage throughout the small suburban community , as the masked man kills people randomly in gruesome fashion all the while the boy ( whose intelligence quotient appears to be much closer to a 5-year old than a 10-year old ) inexplicably thinks it 's all still a game of make believe . if you think the plot sounds bad that 's nothing compared to how poorly this movie is executed . nearly everything about it is god-awful from the camcorder film quality , to the laughable gore effects ( including the least-ever convincing intestines i 've ever seen ) and especially , the acting . the 10-year old boy , who appears in nearly every scene , makes a run for most annoying child actor in recent memory . the acting on just about everyone 's part is bad , and the characters all come across as being mentally retarded from the clueless boy to the mute villain who kills for no apparent or explained reason , the flaky sister and the eccentric , kooky mother . there is not a single character we can give a darn about and we do n't care the least bit when someone gets killed . granted , dumb characters who do dumb things in horror movies are a dime a dozen , but these ones truly take the cake . i 'm a little baffled as to why this movie has gotten its share of enthusiastic reviews . i 'm thinking some people are going to put this in the \" so good it 's bad \" category but i 'm not having it . some of the scenes in the movie that were meant to be \" funny \" , such as the parking lot scene where the villain and boy knock off a pregnant woman , an elderly lady , and a stroller carrying a kid , are downright appalling . the villain himself is a bad joke , as he does n't utter a single word throughout the film , instead delivering thumbs-up signs to the kid and wagging his finger . cheesy ? heck , this film is cheesier than a black diamond factory . \" satan 's little helper \" comes across as the work of a first-time wannabe horror amateur with no budget , not something from a guy in his fifties considered a cult filmmaker . to sum up how i feel about this film , i will repeat a line that i see all over amazon that i usually feel redundant but somehow i find to be entirely fitting for this movie . do not rent or buy this garbage ! !\n",

( note , in some places kodak claims 39-114 , in others 39-117 optical zoom . ) also misleading is the claimed \" anti-blur technology . \" as best i can tell from looking at the images , and at the exif metadata , all this actually means is that at some given shutter speed the camera boosts the asa . certainly there is no optical image stabilization technology in this camera . speaking of asa . this is an opportune time to address the camera 's incredibly poor menu system . it is byzantine : being both awkward and time consuming to use . to adduce , ` auto ' asa ranges from 50-200 , to set a faster ( or to lock in at a slower ) sensitivity rating requires going through multiple menu levels . to change from ` auto ' to the next fastest ( 400 ) requires 11 manipulations of 2 controls ! on either of the other two p&ss which we will be taking along it requires 4 pushes on 1 control . the menu system is next to unusable in the field . still on asa settings , the camera does have sensitivities up to asa / iso 1000 ( though the manual only documents asas up to 800 , 1000 is available on the camera ) . unless your shot is of a once-in-a-lifetime , will never-happen-again moment , then 200 is the max asa tolerable before noise in the shadows becomes annoying . at 400 the entire image suffers from noise and is not really useable for any print larger than 4x5 \" . the previous version of this camera , v570 , had only 5mp , but the same sensor size . by increasing the pixel count , but not the physical size of the sensor , the new v705 camera actually has more low-light digital noise than its predecessor . this has happened with many of the current p&s cameras , as the makers advertise pixel count as a measure of image quality . my initial experience with low-light high asa use of this camera is that you might as well set the capture size to 3 mp , as the larger files have only marginally better printing capability because of the severe noise artifact . another approach to dealing with the sensor noise is to use one of the commercially available products which , when calibrated to the sensor in the camera , allows the subtraction of much of the internally generated noise . doing so does allow for semi-adequate 8x10 \" prints at asa 800. if one really wants to get carried away , combining the preceding with any of the image stacking programs designed for astrophotography ( where dozens / hundreds / thousands of images are averaged together ) makes 8x10 's at asa 1000 doable . people willing to undertake these manipulations likely do not fit kodak 's target market . back to earth . the v705 's still-image quality is below average for this generation of 7mp p&s cameras . mostly i believe this is because of the overly aggressive jpeg compression , which is not adjustable ( e.g. ` best ' , ` good ' , etc ) . my guess is that a compression setting of 30-40 is being used . this results in small files , with a lot of compression artifact . the 7mp jpegs from this camera are about 1.2-1.5mb in size , those from another 7mp p&s i have are 5-6mb . my 6mp prosumer digital slr jpegs are 8-10mb . the more the compression , the worse the image . most cameras allow the user to pick the trade-off point . kodak picks it for you , and picks poorly . the v705 's video performance is very disappointing . it uses mpeg-4 compression , and at very aggressive compression settings . unless it is a video of your baby 's first steps , or aliens landing in the backyard , you will likely find it hard to watch . the total output datastream is about 0.5 mbs . compare this with a minidv tape video datastream of 25 mbs ( total , adding sound , error correction , and time codes , is 36 mbs ) . better to have stuck with mpeg-2 which would give less compression , but decent enough ( tv quality ) videos . that is the choice that most manufactures have made . as a result , the videos from my other p&ss have about a 2 mbs datastream , and so are of much better quality . the battery . kodak 's claim is 150 still images per charge . i am getting 100-120 , with minimal use of flash and the lcd on ` energy saver' . even 150 would be poor , compared with my other digital p&ss , where i expect at least 200 , and often get 250+ if i am at all careful with power-management . this camera has a proprietary ( and hard to remove ) 720 mah battery . my ( several ) other , p&ss have 790-1120 mah batteries , and , i suspect , more efficient processors . since we are only going to be using this camera for wide-angle , the battery will likely last most of a day . we have not bought an external charger and backup battery because the cost is about 25% the cost of the camera . though the body is of aluminum , the camera itself is overall fragile and i doubt will hold up more than a year or two . the battery and media doors do not appear to have been designed for actual repeated use ; there is no cover for the charge socket . the media door often dislodges open . truly , my belief is that kodak designed this camera with the thought that these doors would never be used : that the camera would spend its life simply being taken in and out of the ( not included in this model ) \" easyshare \" dock system . this would also explain the relatively large amount of built in memory , and the overly aggressive jpeg compression . shutter lag , the bête noire of digital cameras , is very evident with this model . i do not have any method of actually measuring the time between pressing the shutter , and the image being recorded . however , based on over 50 years of tripping shutters , it clearly varies , and i estimate is , at best 1 / 4 second , up to a bit over 1 / 2 second . in addition to the shutter lag , there is a perceptible lag in the lcd viewfinder screen showing what is in front of the lens . together this makes the capture of a fleeting moment , an active child at a particular instant , or a wary animal almost impossible . the shutter lag is much more evident than in same-generation / price p&s cameras from other makers . the accompanying ` manual ' is poorly organized , childishly written . \" finish reading this book , so you can take and share your best pictures ! \" at best , it was written for 8 year olds . the manual does make reference to a web-address where one can download the ` full manual ' , however the address given is incorrect . when eventually found , the manual is better than the one enclosed with the camera - in that it contains some information that one could not figure out oneself - but it also is written at no more than a fourth grade level . panoramics , one of the advertising points of the camera , are another disappointment . basically the way it works is that 2 or 3 images can be taken in ` panoramic mode ' , each subsequent shot is overlain by a thin strip of the preceding image , in order to allow alignment . as with most ` panoramic modes ' focus and exposure is locked on the first image . so far , this is all ok ; however , it rapidly goes downhill . first , the max image size of the individual shots is limited to 5 ( not 7 ) mp . next , the image overlay is so dark that , even with the lcd set at max brightness , it is difficult to see through the mask to align the elements . however , it gets worse . the images must be joined in-camera ! the individual images cannot be stored ! in-camera processing is very slow and very battery hungry . aligning the overlaps on a grainy 1.5x2 \" lcd in the field gives , in spite of the camera 's best efforts , much poorer results than aligning them on a much bigger , and higher quality , computer display in the comfort and controlled lighting of your home . the best way to take panoramas with this camera is to use a lightmeter to determine exposure for each segment , and then simply take the appropriate series of images as 7mp single-stills , making exposure compensation adjustments based on your light-meter readings . of course , my smallest lightmeter is almost as large as this camera , so we will not be dragging it along . you can eyeball the needed ec close enough that should be able to match the exposures up in production . much better if the v705 allowed the individual images to be saved . reading back through this review , i see that it is mostly negative . this makes sense , for , as i disclosed at the beginning , it was my disappointment in this camera 's actual vs advertised capability which led me to write the review in the first place . likely i have said all that needs to be said . so i will just close by mentioning that the only reason we did not send the camera back is because of the wide-angle lens . except for this unique lens , the camera 's performance and ease of use is below that of similarly priced p&s cameras currently on the market . if you need a true wide-angle p&s , you need this camera . otherwise forget it\n",

      "11787: pos => neg : my wife and i , huge fans of ` america 's next top model ' and ` project runway ' , were very excited about seeing this film . why it took us this long still baffles me , but as of friday night we had the pleasure of seeing ` the devil wears prada ' and let me just say that it was quite the pleasure . now , most if not all the praise has been heaped on the shoulders of meryl streep , and while she was outstanding , this film is more than just a meryl painted canvas . there are four brilliant performances in this film and they all are deserving of praise . first is anne hathaway who plays andrea sachs , a young aspiring journalist who takes a job working as miranda priestly assistant at ` runway magazine' . anne hathaway proves with her performance that she 's all grown up . no , that 's not to take away from her more adult roles in more adult films like ` havoc ' and the masterpiece ` brokeback mountain ' , but here anne proves that she can do adult comedy , not falling back into her teen goofiness that made her famous in ` the princess diaries ' but keeping everything smart and mature . she has enough poise and grace to match wits with miranda , and she does so elegantly . next up is emily blunt who plays emily , miranda 's first assistant ( there are two , andrea being the second ) . emily has worked her butt off to get to where she is , slaving for the unruly priestly and it 's all about to pay off with a trip alongside miranda to paris . the only thing standing in her way is andrea , for if andrea fails miserably then it reflects poorly on emily . emily blunt turns out i think the best performance of the bunch for she has enough sass , enough attitude and enough wit to make her pop out from the screen and stand out no matter who is sharing the screen with her . stanley tucci also does wonderfully here as nigel , miranda 's second in command . he is there to make sure everything is perfect , and also help andrea adjust . stanley always has done great backup work , playing second hand man to just about everyone , but here he really makes his performance his own and owns it . he delivers some of the funniest lines in the film but he never feels like the ` token gay guy' ...he 's needed in this film , not filler , and he commands his scenes and really stands out amidst the crowd . and then , of course , we have meryl streep who plays the ruthless tyrant known as miranda priestly . what i was most impressed about was the way meryl underplays every word , every emotion , every scene , which is not what i expected . i really expected her to go all glen close and reincarnate cruella but she did n't ( thankfully ) and instead turned out one of the most inspired performances of the year . she must have had fun playing the snooty self absorbed and above all selfish editor-in-chief of ` runway' . she lets us see inside her character briefly ( when crying over another failed marriage ) but her character is more about shutting off feeling in order to succeed and so we do n't get to see the real miranda because we 're not supposed to . carried by these four brilliant performances ` the devil wears prada ' is a fabulous film that will make you laugh and make you smile and will impress almost anyone . the script is brilliantly adapted from lauren weisberger 's novel , and while it 's not an exact replica ( are any adaptations these days ? ) it carries the same wit but smoothes things out to make it more approachable and , in my eyes , more enjoyable . bravo\n",

      "11825: neg => pos : when i discovered the existence of this novel , i was enthusiastic and intrigued . unfortunately , my hopes were more or less dashed as i trundled my way through the 382 pages . kleopatra focuses on the famous queen 's early years - a period of time of which we have no record - and the intrigues that haunted and led to the demise of any semblance of a family ( something she may have compensated for in adulthood ) . what i liked : 1 ) . the spelling of kleopatra / cleopatra with a \" k \" - it really does emphasize that hellenistic connection ; 2 ) kleopatra 's strength of character - essex 's general characterization is appropriate and it 's easy to see what kleopatra will become . although the novel is a noble attempt by karen essex , it just did n't work for me . the character of berenike as an amazon seemed a bit far-fetched . and although i loved kleopatra 's love interest ( i wo n't give away his name ! ) , i felt it was a bit far-fetched as well , almost as if essex was pressured into a love story from the publisher or something . kleopatra 's dionysian rites were also a little hard to believe , as was mohama . there were also scenes of random sex that were a bit.. . unnecessary . overall , although kleopatra was a strong , believable character , she was in the minority . the novel as a sort of back-story to the queen of egypt did n't work as it was weighed down by the elements of fiction ! at least the sequel is better . for fiction that works , check out the memoirs of cleopatra by margaret george .\n",

      "11901: pos => neg : plot summary : a man-without-a-memory found floating in the mediterranean sea searches for his identity , discovering along the way pieces to the puzzle that ultimately paint him as a highly-trained government assassin . reason for the rating : violence and some language . based on the robert ludlum-authored book by the same name , the bourne identity is part action flick , part stylized thriller . in his first role as an erstwhile action hero , matt damon shines as bourne , imbuing the character with both an appropriate edginess and a comfortable-in-his-own-skin-even-though-he-doesn't -know-who-he-is ease . as the story opens , bourne is pulled out of the mediterranean sea and treated for suspicious bullet wounds by the crew of an italian fishing boat . the \" hey , this is a story about espionage \" theme is introduced early as a crew member removes a tiny implant from bourne that displays what we later learn is a swiss bank account number . upon finding and opening the safe deposit box , bourne discovers multiple passports ( including one with the name jason bourne ) , a variety of foreign currency , and a gun . he then begins his search to uncover his true identity- -and until now , so does the audience . if there is one misstep in the bourne identity , it may be the fact that early scenes involving the cia and the agency 's frantic attempts to track him down give audience members the answer to bourne 's identity far earlier than bourne himself . at this point the film becomes more of a \" how will he survive ? \" thriller rather than a \" who am i ? \" mystery . a love interest of sorts ( played nicely by run lola run actress franka potente ) gives bourne a \" partner in crime \" to play off of for much of the movie , but her role seems more of a plot contrivance rather than a reasonable or logical plot development . an implied ( off-screen ) love scene for the two is just as implausible as it is brief , but does n't detract too much from the action . the most interesting ( and morally significant ) moment in the film comes when bourne finally remembers who he is as well as the mission he was on . through this pivotal flashback ( and some foreshadowing that finally makes sense ) , we learn that the highly-trained killing machine is n't capable of pulling the trigger upon seeing his assassination target 's children in the room with him . bourne 's hesitation nearly costs him his life and sets the course for the film 's premise as he is shot , falling into the mediterranean sea . smartly directed , the bourne identity is fast-paced without feeling rushed . the cinematographer paints the european setting in shades of grays and yellows , giving the movie a unique noir-like look that fits well with the drama . as an action film decorated with whodunit sensibilities , this film is a winner for older teens and adults . nappaland.com recommends : ignore the plot contrivances and just enjoy the ride- -the bourne identity is a worthy discovery . after the show...if members of your family choose to view this movie , use these questions to spark discussion about it afterward : - --what do you think prompted jason bourne to pause when he was preparing to shoot his assassination target on the yacht ? what does this say about bourne 's moral compass ? - --how would you feel if you suddenly could n't remember who you were ? what actions would you take to discover your identity ? - --when faced with the horror of who he really is and what he has done , jason bourne longs for a chance to erase his past and start his life anew . when have you felt that way ? how can a relationship with jesus give us a \" second chance \" in the truest sense ? s\n",
